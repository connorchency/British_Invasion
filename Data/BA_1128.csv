"11","Dionne Warwick","You Can Have Him","Well, you can have him, I don't want him, He didn't love me anyway. He only wanted someone to play with But all I wanted was love to stay.  Well, you get stuck with the wrong man There's only one thing that you can do: Just dig a hole and jump right in it, And pull the ground right over you.  Well, you can have him I don't want him I don't Want him, He didn't love me anyway anyway. He only wanted someone to play with But all I wanted was love to stay.  The boy I love, he, up and left me, He ran away with my best friend. Comes home at night just for an hour When day light comes he's gone again.  Life without love is mighty empty, But confessions good for the soul. I'd rather have love that I can cling to Than have the world and all of it's gold.  You can have him, I don't want Him, He didn't love me, anyway. He only wanted some one to Play with Ohhhhhhhh! Was love to stayohhhhhhhhh!  You can have him Iiiiiiiiii don't want him He didn't love me anyway anyway He only wanted someone to play with someone to play With But all I want All I want All I want All I want",3

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
And then suddenly I awake and look around me  
At these cold grey walls that surround me  
And it's then that I realize that I was only dreaming  
For there stands a guard and there's the sad old padre  
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak  
And once again I'll touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home...

It isn't easy, but I'll try  If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love'  The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return?  If you wanted the moon I would try to make a star But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir, With Love'",1
