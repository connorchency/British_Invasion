VDon't try and understand me, you never could do that   Ah, and in the end you'd wind up being hurt   I'm a man with too many problems that keep pounding on my brain     So if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth   (if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)     I don't pretend to be a saint, my sins they are many   But there's no-one perfect in this universe   And though you think I'm weird, don't try and change me dear     Cause if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth   (if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)     Hear a howling wind outside my door, there's restlessness within   Oh, I'm like a raincloud that one day may burst   We both know I'll be leavin' and if one little tear you grieve     Ah, it's all right 'cause that's all I'm really worth   (it's all right 'cause that's all I'm really worth)     And if you think about me in your lonesome hours   Ah, and on your lips there's a sweet word and not a curse   Ah, then I'll be comin' back one day when my wandering is over     Ah, if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth   (if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)   Ah, if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth   (if you want me you'll take me for what I'm worth)

VGo away from my world,Let me dream alone.And you see it never worked from the start,All I got for all of my love was a broken heart.Go away from my world,And let me dream alone.I'll dry my eyes and comb my hair,And I'll pretend you're never there.Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadlyYou never could understand the love I wanted so badly.Go away from my world,And let me walk all alone.All alone in my room,All alone and so sad.I can dream of how I wanted us to beDreams I have the kind I knew could ever be.Go away from my world.

p288
VI met him at a party just a couple of years ago,He was rather over-hearty and ridiculousBut as I'd seen him on the screen he cast a certain spell.I'd basked in his attractionFor a couple of hours or so.His manners were a fraction too meticulous,If he was real or not, I couldn't tell,But like a silly fool I fellMad about the boy,I know it's stupidTo be mad about the boy.I'm so ashamed of itBut must admitThe sleepless nightsI've had about the boy.On the silver screenHe melts my foolish heartIn every single scene.Although I'm quite awareThat here and thereAre traces of that cared about the boy.Lord knows I'm not a fool girl,I really shouldn't care.Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirlIn the flurry of her first affair.Will it ever cloyThis odd diversity of misery and joyI'm feeling quite insaneAnd young againAnd all becauseI'm mad about the boy.It seems a little sillyFor a girl of my age and weightTo walk down piccadilly in a haze of light.It ought to take her a good deal moreTo take a bad girl down.I should've been exempt for my particular kind of fateAs taught me such contempt for every phase of loveAnd now I've been and spent my love torn crownTo weep about a painted clown.Mad about the boy,It's pretty funnyBut I'm mad about the boy.He has a gay appeal that makes me feelThere's maybe something sad about the boy.Walking down the streetHis eyes look out at me from people that I meet.I can't believe it's true,But when I'm blue, in some strange wayI'm glad about the boy.I'm hardly sentimental,Love isn't so sublime.I have to pay my rentalAnd I can't afford to waste much time.If I could employ a little magicThat would finally destroyThis dream that pains me and it shames meBut I can't because I'm mad about the boy.

You must learn to say no toThe joys of this world, for this world is a snare;Only the fools of this world will let you go,Who don't care a damn, don't care a damn,Don't care a damn, will be made to care.Don't let the flesh and it's longings get you.Remember the price that a lover must pay,And say to yourself when temptations beset you -What is the use? What is the use?Beauty will perish and youth pass away.Sister, you know, when our life here is over,Those who were good to go to bliss unalloyed,Those who were bad are rejected forever,Gnashing their teeth, gnashing their teeth,Gnashing their teeth in a gibbering void. "FamilyWho fights the good fight and all self subduesWins the Palm, gains the Crown.

"Then sorrow struck my heart,Tears began to stream down from my eyes.The only man that I ever loved in all my lifeOut here, in a place and a condition like this.And I began thinkin' about what my mama told me when I was a little girl.She told me when I couldn't help myselfTo get down on my knees and pray.And I fell down on my kneesAnd these are the words that I said:"Save me, save me, save me, babe,Save me, save me, save me, dear.Oh, I don't know just how I made it,But I'm so glad our love is here.

That was the reason (as all men know,In this kingdom by the sea)That the wind came out of the cloud by night,Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee;But our love it was stronger by far than the loveOf those who were older than we Of many far wiser than we And neither the angels in heaven above,Nor the demons down under the sea,Can ever dissever my soul from the soulOf the beautiful Annabel Lee,For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreamsOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyesOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the sideOf my darling my darling my life and my bride,In the sepulcher there by the sea,In her tomb by the sounding sea

VI know you're out there having a good time.Spaced out chicks, love potions and good wine.Don't make me laugh, you're not in there alone,There's other people's voices in the room.Don't hang up, I didn't mean it that way,No eye communication, always happens this way.How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?No eye communication always happens that way.I know I shouldn't let it happen,There's no excuse, I felt so alone.You know how it is, our lure was meant to trap them,And then they find some poison of their own.Don't hang up, I didn't mean it that way,No eye communication, always happens this way.How can I say what I mean, mean what I say?No eye communication always happens

VAlas my love you do me wrongTo cast me off discourteouslyFor i have loved you so longDelighting in your company.Greensleeves was all my joy,Greensleeves was my delight.Greensleeves was my heart of goldAnd who but my lady Greensleeves ?Alas my love that you should ownA heart of wanton vanitySo i must laddie think aloneUpon your insincerity.Greensleeves

sS'Spanish Is A Loving Tongue'
p511
VSpanish is a loving tongueSoft as music, light as spray'twas a boy I learnt it fromLiving down sonora way.He didn't look much like a loverYet I say his love words overOften when I'm all alone,Mi amor, mi corazon.Moonlight on the patio,Old seÒora nodding near.Me and juan were talking lowSo the madre couldn't hear.How those hours would go a-flyingAnd too soon I'd hear him sighing,Softly murmuring sweet and low,"mi amor, mi corazon."Haven't seen him since that night,He can't cross the line you know.Wanted for a gambling fight,Well, perhaps it's better so.Yet I sometimes sort of miss himSince that last sad night I kissed himSoftly murmuring sweet and low,"adios, mi corazon."

One, two! And through and throughThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!He left it dead, and with it's headHe went galumphing back."And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?Come to my arms, my beamish boy!O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! "He chortled in his joy.'Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wabe.All mimsey were the borogrovesAnd the mome raths outgrabe.

VHere I lie in my hospital bed.Tell me, Sister Morphine, when are you coming round again ? *Tell her she must come, have to make it quickOr attend the sick'Cause there must be something she can do,This heart is broken in two.Tell her it's a state of emergency,There's a case she's got in the name of humanity.Night nurse,Only you alone can quench this thirst.My night nurse,Oh God,All the pain is getting worse.I don't wanna see no doc,I need attendance from my nurse around the clockFor there's no prescription for me,She is the one, the only remedy.Night nurse,Only you alone can quench this thirst.My night nurse,Oh God,All the pain is getting worse.I'm hurt by love.I don't wanna see no doc,I need attendance from my nurse around the clockFor there's no prescription for me,She is the one, the only remedy.Night nurse,Only you alone can quench this thirst.Night nurse,Oh God,All the pain is getting worse.I'm hurt by loveAnd I'm sureNo doctor can cure.Night nurseNight nurseNight nurse.

VWhy is it that civilized humanityCan make the world so wrong ?In this hurly-burly of insanityOur dreams cannot last long.We've reached a deadline,A press headline,Every sorrow.Blues valueIs news valueTomorrow.Blues Twentieth century bluesAre getting me down.Blues Escape those wearyTwentieth century blues.Why,If there's a God in the sky,Why shouldn't He grinHighAbove this drearyTwentieth century din ?In this strange illusion,Chaos and confusion,People seem to lose their way.What is there to strive for,Love or keep alive for,Say, 'Hey, hey!'Call it a day ?Blues Nothing to win or to lose,It's getting me down.Blues Escape those wearyTwentieth century blues.We've reached a deadline,A press headline,Every sorrow.Blues valueIs news valueTomorrow.Blues Nothing to win or to lose,It's getting me down.Blues Escape those drearyTwentieth centuryBlues.

VHeaven's rain falls uponFaces of the children who look skyward.Twisting metal through the air,Scars and screamsSo you might know his fury.[Chorus]See shells whistle,Let your mind drift away.See shells whistle,Let yourself hide away.Men walking tallLooking so small.Green trees of life disappearing.Mouthing the sounds.Face clowning the frownsBlack the lips of command.Torn in the heart.You're playing the partCourage it is so demandingLoud brass in bands.Marching through lands.Life snatching hand is near.Heaven's army falls upon.The skirts of mother earth and then flies skywards.Twisting wings through the airLift the souls,So you might know his fury.[Chorus]Dressed in white silk of rainYou marry the pain.As you kneel in a church of bright steelA new morning arrives.You share the same skies.Umbrella-ring a land full of peaceAs the memory fadesOn the edge of a blade.You'll return you 're sure that you will.From the frame in your handA smile expands.Hangs from a thread of glass tears.

VI got myself some good newsI bought myself some blue suede shoesI took down my suit and I pressed it.I shook up my body, and I lost that girl.Well I made my first mistakeAsking that little girl to waitShe was the icing on my cakeAnd now she's gone, and I lost that girl.She gives me the heebie-jeebiesShakes me down to my knees.She waits till I really get rollingThen she passes me like a breezeYou know the red light sealed my fateI knew then I'd be lateWhen I got there she gave me the freezeShe said you're gone boy, and I lost that girlHelp me find her dick.I was out in search of a good timeScanning the streets I felt fineI fell for that perfect double crossLucked out, and I lost that girl.Policeman in the car park,Waiting for me outsideYou know he give me that real heat treatmentWhen the flashlight hit my eyes.You know I made my second mistakeAsking that cop to waitHe said I'm gonna put you away for good, andYou'll be gone and he said here boy you're really dead.Lost that girl.

VAs I sit at my pianoWaiting for something to form in my head,Bits and pieces, just like a jigsaw,What if that jigsaw saw something up ahead.Up ahead just waiting for me,Gonna track it down it won't take long,And in just an hour or twoIt'll be wrapped up and I'll give it to you.My song, and I will give it to you.My song.Up ahead just waiting for me,Gonna track it down it won't take long,And in just an hour or twoIt'll be wrapped up and I'll give it to you.My song, and I will give it to you.

sS'Edge Of The Night'
p702
VI saw the canopies, beneath the buildings discreetThe hour's late and not a soul on the street,As I stood alone there, at the edge of the night.With all your wisdom, you had gone to bed earlyI hesitated and just think what it cost meJust like a victim in the sights it doesn't feel rightAt the edge of the night.I had the backbone but then, I heard it cracking.I faced the terror but I found myself lackingWhat good is courage here, at the edge of the night.At the edge of the night.There was this man,Gun in his hand,That wanted to waste meMy mouth became dry,I reached for the sky,The sight seemed to freeze meHe said he'd been a hero,Now he'd fallen down to zeroAin't it a crimeWhoooI handed over all I had on my personMy Bank America card and this was my first oneThen he just stepped right out of sight, at the edge of the nightAt the edge of the night.

sS'The Journey'
p704
VCity it leaves without tracesBlind sparrow's carry me.Resting my head on a rainbowHigh in a tree.Laughing at me.Crying at me.Seeing through me.In mirrors of tears I'm reflectedWhite naked figures twist the key.Turning my thoughts into shadows.Playing on the walls of me.Laughing at me.Crying at me.Seeing through me.

p706
VAs silver tears they weave and lace,Sad patterns upon her face,She waits for you. So low below a laser sun,Through velvet fields she runs,Reaching for you. And so you bleed now,Your hand holds the knife That is tearing your life apart.Why don't you leave now, The city's too heavyAnd your dreams they melt in the sun. On mellow blue, birds curve and glide.Through shadows of grief she slides,She waits for you.There on a hill before the dawn,In silence a promise torn,She turns from you.And so you bleed now ...As silver tears, they weave and lace, She waits for you.So low below a laser sun,Reaching for you.On mellow blue birds curve and glide.She waits for you.There on a hill before the dawn,She turns from you...

sS"It's Been So Long"
p708
VI went down to the muddy riverWhere the blind fish do swim.I saw the face on the drowning moonAnd I nearly jumped in.Sad sirens on the waterThey call to me through the night.They sing of you, their song is blue,And so is the pain.It 's been so long.Oh lord, won't you help me,Now I'm in such distress,My song is blue, and so are you,That's why I'm in such a mess.It 's been so long.Out in the moonlight,Beside macadam highway,You put out your thumb, maggie babyYou sure went a long way.The neon angel passed you by,He said old river seemed to sigh,Separated, from you past,We sometimes die.It 's been so long.

sS'Is It Only Love'
p710
VI said before, and now I'm sureIt's time to speak the truthSay what I feel insideThere's nothing left to loseOnly time can turn the tide.Is it only love that lets you downIs it only love that lets youIs it only love that lets you down.The morning came, it brought the rainWaking up to find she'd goneAnd there's no-one else aroundAnd your feeling so aloneAnd you knew it all along.Is it only love that lets you downIs it only love that lets youIs it only love that lets you down.But you need it, 'cause you said so,Were you crying, when he said no, no,Did he want it, did he say it,Would you still forgive himEven it he said, I'm sorry.Is it only love that lets you downIs it only love that lets youIs it only love that lets you down.

VOld man going.Hopscotch of life will lead you to the grave.Wet faces line the street, they will not be saved.Black house you've built it will soon disappear,Another corporation dig this year.Old man going.Traffic thins as you drive slowly by,A friend wipes a flower from an eye.Streets filled with bouquets from a cloudy skyThey'll soon forget the field in which you lie.Old man going.

VIn the concrete valleys the electric storm.We members of the midnight circus,Our bodies so brightly adornIn your long sedans and your Oldsmobiles,Through that slit in your face, you ask me,How it feels. Can you hear me, can you hear me,I'm a-telling you again.Daughters of Satan all stand in line,With faces greased and a mouth full of shine.With iron hand you bruise the flesh,Then through a closing door you ask, Pray why the distress.Hear me, can you hear me, can you.Midnight sailors can stay,We won't send you away,See me here on my knees. You lie in the alley, with blood on your clothes.As fingers round your throat they close.Your cries of murder, splash on the wallsAs you die, you think about the injustice of it all.Can you hear me ...Hear me ...See Satan's daughters' red light,They have such good appetites,Another clown packs his drag ...

p726
VIt was a grey dawn, penciled in lightlyThe morning screamed, neath the traffic's feetThe razor burned commuters reflectionsIt didn't seem a visual treat.The office staff begin the humdrumMaking the hours and the money flow.The guilty lovers keep their secretAnd hope it doesn't show.Oh no office love is such a bitchOh no like a knife in the backHe catches the train up every morningFrom his Croyden executive estateHe's convinced he needs a new futureBut she's prepared to waitHe swears to step cleanly from a marriageThat's become so tangled and confusedShe knows he's lying for his pleasuresHe doesn't see her cry.He doesn't see her die.Oh no office love is such a bitchOh no like a knife in the backShe goes home, knowing that it can't go onHer secret fears become too strongSeeing what little love she has she's losingHe's the type that manages to sleep at nightThe guilt is safely locked awayBut it was just another day, and he's so tired.Her heart seemed set on destructionWith lips drawn pale and thinShe offered up love like a sacrificeAnd he was closing in.Her mother sat on the end of the bedThrough the dark hours of the nightWagging her finger saying honeyThis just isn't right.Oh no office love is such a bitchOh no like a knife in the back

VFor ten weeks now number three stood emptyNobody thought there would beFamily laughter behind the windowsOr a Christmas tree.Then a couple from up northSorrow and his wife arrivedBefore the sun had left the streetsThey were living inside.Then before too longThe street it rang with the soundFrom number three there came a cryS. F. Sorrow is born.The sunlight of his daysWas spent in the grey of his mindAs he stole love with a tongue of liesThe world is shrinking in size.

She said:(Refrain):The angels are cying in heaven tonightTheir hearts are so heavy,They've got tears in their eyes.The angels are cying in heaven tonight'Cause they can't understand,Why we can't find the light.She said they cry for all the lies we live with everyday,And for all the children sick and in the rain.For the noble dreams that somehow seem to always be in vain,And for the the gentle hearts who still believe in the miracle of faith.It seems so strange that a little girl could know so much about a troubled world,But now I see, she had to be an angel in disguise.RefrainAnd the Angels are crying....RefrainAnd the Angels are crying....

Take a trip out here. Hustle, bustle, shove and fuss Will greet you if you stay there. I'm without a care. Fresh fruit and sea fish, Are in abundance here. But they don't allow The natives at your door Selling booze Smuggled from another shore. And Chorus Verse 3 Verse 4 Chorus Postcard, postcard, postcard

VOut of the sky the rain comes driving down Washing away the hills of darkest brown Heading out through another country town White lace curtains Something certainly gets into me Call it jealousy And when I'm so far away Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway Somewhere inside me Somewhere above the night And maybe you've gone your way And I'll go my way Somewhere inside me Somewhere inside the night Maybe it's dawn Out of my heart my love comes falling free Healing the pain that burns you and me Heading towards another warm country Smiles are dancing shades entrancingly Gets into me Call it fantasy And when I'm so far away Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway Somewhere inside me Somewhere above the night And maybe you've gone your way And I've gone my way Somewhere inside me Somewhere inside the night Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway Somewhere inside me Somewhere above the night And maybe you've gone your way And I've gone my way Somewhere inside me Somewhere inside the night And maybe it's dawn In the city where I'll be Maybe it's dawn When you're near me

VRoundLike a circle in a spiralLike a wheel within a wheelNever ending or beginningOn an ever-spinning reelLike a snowball down a mountainOr a carnival balloonLike a carousel that's turningRunning rings around the moonLike a clock whose hands are sweepingPast the minutes of its faceAnd the world is like an appleWhirling silently in spaceLike the circles that you findIn the windmills of your mindLike a tunnel that you followTo a tunnel of its ownDown a hollow to a cavernWhere the sun has never shoneLike a door that keeps revolvingIn a half-forgotten dreamOr the ripples from a pebbleSomeone tosses in a streamLike a clock whose hands are sweepingPast the minutes of its faceAnd the world is like an appleWhirling silently in spaceLike the circles that you findIn the windmills of your mindKeys that jingle in your pocketWords that jangle in your headWhy did summer go so quickly?Was it something that you said?Lovers walk along a shoreAnd leave their footprints in the sandIs the sound of distant drummingJust the fingers of your hand?Pictures hanging in a hallwayAnd the fragment of a songHalf-remembered names and facesBut to whom do they belong?When you knew that it was overIn the autumn of goodbyesFor a moment you could not recallThe colour of his eyesLike a circle in a spiralLike a wheel within a wheelNever ending or beginningOn an ever-spinning reelAs the images unwindLike the circles that you findIn the windmills of your mind

sS'Farewell'
p1771
VLooking at the world around,For the very first time.Never seen it all before,Hope it's not all mine.On Monday morning all alone,I woke within my house of stone.I ventured forth unto the day,These things I saw upon my way.Trees and flowers were wrapped around,With people's castoffs on the ground.Roads and noise of glass and steel,And people snared within the wheel.Tuesday looked into the sky,Where birds in peace were left to fly.Thunder rolled and lightning flashed,I watched the world as people dashed.Friday's sadness began to creep,Upon me like the deepest sleep.It seemed that only I could see,Just what my world would finally be.On Sunday back inside my room,I draw the blinds, 'tis afternoon.I let my mind find its own ways,Farewell to future days.

VLong ago in days of oldThere lived a knight whoWasn't quite as boldAs a knight should beHe rode an old grey mare called BessSearchin' for a damsel in distressJust to see if heCould set her freeSee the knight in rusty armour rideTo her aidTrusty sword is hanging at his sideWith a rusty bladeUp the tower steps he sneakedBut as he movedHis rusty armour squeakedSuch a mournful noteAnd all the sentries at their postsThought it must have been the castle ghostThey jumped for their livesIn the moatSo the knight in rusty armour wonHis fair maidHad no need to draw his trusty swordWith a rusty bladeAs he bent to kiss his brideHe found that he wasRusted up insideIn his battle dressAnd I can't guessHow they still got marriedAnd had twinsThey came in tinsEvery suit of armour ever madeHas a kinkChain mail pants with a missing link

sS'After You Came'
p1917
VSince it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessingIf I can come through than so can youAnd you will find there's no regrettingThings you want from your life's fontWill never let your spirit roamCome back to Earth for what it's worthFor you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home[Chorus]I've been doing my bestWhat else can I do?Is there something I've missedThat will help you throughI have reached the top of the wallAnd all I've found is another way to fallFor some short timeFor a while you and I were joined to eternityThen we split in two back tome and youLike the rain rising from the seaRising from the seaWe all can see what we shall beBut knowing's not really controllingWith time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understandingAfter you'd come and while you're goneYou leave me guessing, it's depressingNever to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressingSo you just have to laughWhen it hurts so muchYou're so far away and so hard to touchI have reached the top of the wallAnd all I've found is another way to fallSince it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessingIf I can come through than so can youAnd you will find there's no regrettingThings you want from your life's fontWill never let your spirit roamCome back to Earth for what it's worthFor you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home[Chorus]

p1919
VI've been searching for my dreamA hundred times todayI build them up, you knock them down,Like they were made of clay,Then the tide rushes inAnd washes my castles away.Then I'm really not so sureWhen side of the bed I should lay,I should lay...You keep looking for someoneTo tell your troubles to,I'll sit down and lend an earYet I hear nothing new.Then the tide rushes inAnd washes my castles away.Then I'm really not so sureWhen side of the bed I should lay,I should lay...Blackbird sitting in a treeObserving what's belowAcorns falling to the ground,He'll stay and watch them grow.

VNice to be here hope you agreeLying in the sunLovely weather, must climb a treeThe show has just begunAll the leaves start swayingTo the breeze that's playingOn a thousand violinsAnd the bees are hummingTo a frog sat strummingOn a guitar with only one stringI can see them they can't see meI feel out of sightI can see them they can't see meMuch to my delightAnd it seems worth notingWater rats were boatingAs a lark began to singThe sounds kept comingWith Jack Rabbit loudly drummingOn the side of a biscuit tinI can see them they can't see meI feel out of sightI can see them they can't see meMuch to my delightSilver minnows were devisingWater ballet so surprisingA mouse played a daffodilA mole came up blinkingUnderneath an owl who's thinkingHow he came to be sat on a hillI can see them they can't see meI feel out of sightI can see them they can't see meMuch to my delightI know you won't believe meBut I'm certain that I did seeA mouse playing daffodilAll the band was really jumpingWith Jack Rabbit in there thumpingI found that I couldn't sit stillI just had to make it with themCause they played my kind of rhythmAnd the bees hummed in harmonyAnd the owl played his oboeThen the frog's guitar soloIt was all just too much for meI know you won't believe meBut I'm certain that I did seeA mouse playing daffodilAll the band was really jumpingWith Jack Rabbit in there thumpingI found that I couldn't sit still

p1923
VWhen the sun goes down, And the clouds all frown, Night has begun for the sunset. See it with your eyes, Earth re-energized By the sun's rays every day. Take a look out there, Planets everywhere. When the sun goes down And the clouds all frown, Night has begun for the sunset. Shadows on the ground Never make a sound, Fading away in the sunset. Night has now become Day for everyone. I can see it all From this great height. I can feel the sun Slipping out of sight And the world still goes on Through the night.

VCold hearted orb that rules the nightRemoves the colors from our sightRed is gray and yellow whiteBut we decide which is rightAnd which is an illusionPinprick holes in a colorless skyLet insipid figures of light pass byThe mighty light of ten thousand sunsChallenges infinity and is soon goneNighttime to some, a brief interludeTo others the fear of solitudeBrave Helios, wake up your steedsBring the warmth the countryside needs

p1929
VI took a ride in a limousine,I took a road I'd never been.I met a stranger by the way,His coat was torn but his eyes were clear.Standing in a slide zone,Steppin' in a slide zone.He told me where a river flows,He showed me how the apple grows.He told me of a magic stream,His face was worn but his eyes were clear.Standing in a slide zone,I could be steppin' in a slide zone.Standing in a slide zone,I could be steppin' through a time zone.He went to find a shooting star,Around the bend, that's where they are.I went along just for the ride,Suddenly I began to slide.Standing in a slide zone,I could be steppin' through a time zone.The air raced by there was no sound,We drifted high above the ground.And then he said you know this place,And then a smile lit up his face.Standing in a slide zone,I could be steppin' in a slide zone.Standing in a slide zone,I could be steppin' through a time zone.I turned my head and I looked below, Slide zone...And there was something there I know.Suddenly I began to fall,I looked around and tried to call.Standing in a slide zone,He had me steppin' in a time zone.Standing in a slide zone,Falling through a time zone.Help me please, I thought I said,Then something happened in my head.Music came from all around,And I knew what I had found.Standing in a slide zone,Falling through a time zone.Steppin' in a slide zone,He had me falling through a time zone.Slide zone, slide zone,Slide zone, time zone.

sS'The Dream'
p1973
VWhen the white eagle of the North is flying overheadThe browns, reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter, dead.Remember then, that summer birds with wings of fire flayingCame to witness springs new hope, born of leaves decaying.Just as new life will come from death, love will come at leisure.Love of love, love of life and giving without measureGives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen.Live hand-in-hand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream.

VI'm a melancholy man, that's what I am, All the world surrounds me, and my feet are on the ground. I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can, All the world astounds me and I think I understand That we're going to keep growing, wait and see. When all the stars are falling down Into the sea and on the ground, And angry voices carry on the wind, A beam of light will fill your head And you'll remember what's been said By all the good men this world's ever known. Another man is what you'll see, Who looks like you and looks like me, And yet somehow he will not feel the same, His life caught up in misery, he doesn't think like you and me, 'Cause he can't see what you and I can see.

VTalk to me baby, I want to sleep at nightMy heart is heavy, it's weighed down by the night.And now I'm lonely, I want to see the lightSo deep within you.Cool wind is blowing through your crazy hair.Warm colours flowing, this feeling we have shared.And now I'm lonely I want tofeel the loveSo deep within you.Your love's a never-ending dreamA castle by a stream of sweet understandingI know you're thinking of me too, the messages>From you are my inspiration.Love's incense lingers, it never fades away.Like you I'm waiting for our special day.And now I'm lonely I want to feelthe loveSo deep within youMy love is burning, like a forest fireMy heart is yearning, I feel a warm desire.And now I'm lonely I want to touch the fireSo deep within you.

VWhen the breeze between us calls,Love comes and lingers into our lives.And the leaves begin to fall,You point your finger at me.I love you, yeah.I love you.In the sadness of your smile,Love is an island way out to sea.But it seems so long ago,We have been ready trying to be free.And it's up to you,Why won't you say?Make our lives turn out this way,If they knew,That we have got nothing to lose.No reason to hide from what's true.In the world of me and you,All is forgotten when we're inside.And the words that pass us by,I am not listening to all of its lies.And it's up to you,Why won't you say?Make our lives turn out this way.If they knew, that we have got nothing to lose,No reason to hide from what's true.Then we have got nothing to lose.

VWhen I think of all the things that we've been through And all the things we've yet to do, I... I start to realize The world is such a lonely place. Want to be with you I remember all the heartaches we have known, The angry nights when we were lonely. The jealousy and pain, Can we remain the same? The world will have to hold its breath. Want to be with you I don't need a reason, I don't need to understand. I just want to be, Want to be with you Only want your love, Only want you by my side, Only want to be, Want to be with you. And when I look back down that road I see the turnings that we both made, The choice we had to make The promises we break Are nothing more than memories. Want to be with you. The jealousy and pain, Can we remain the same? The world will have to hold its breath. Want to be with you. I don't need a reason, I don't need to understand. I just want to be, Want to be with you. Only want your love, Only want you by my side, Only want to be, Want to be with you.

"The world in solemn stillness layTo hear the angels sing.Still through the cloven skies they comeWith peaceful wings unfurled,And still their heavenly music floatsO'er all the weary world;Above its sad and lowly plainsThey bend on hovering wing,And ever o'er its Babel-soundsThe blessed angels sing.Yet with the woes of sin and strifeThe world has suffered long;Beneath the heavenly strain have rolledTwo thousand years of wrong;And man, at war with man, hears notThe tidings which they bring;O hush the noise, ye men of strife,And hear the angels sing!O ye, beneath life's crushing load,Whose forms are bending low,Who toil along the climbing wayWith painful steps and slow,Look now! For glad and golden hoursCome swiftly on the wing;O rest beside the weary roadAnd hear the angels sing!For lo! The days are hastening on,By prophets seen of old,When with the ever-circling yearsShall come the time foretold,When peace shall over all the earthIts ancient splendors fling,And the whole world give back the songWhich now the angels sing.

VBeneath the weight of the world I can be foundAmong the chaos and the wheel, scattered all around.On the wild windy wave I'm tossed, cast away and lost,Now I understand what those sad songs say.Make up your mind to be happy,Life is a merry-go-round.If you miss out this time,Don't let it fret your mind,Love will come round in the end.Make up your mind to be happy,Life is a merry-go-round.If an' you miss out this time,Don't let it fret your mind,Love will come round in the end.Between the devil and the deep blue we find ourselvesOften Out of the frying pan and into, left on the shelf.Borne willy nilly here and there when our hearts are full of care,Oh my, now we understand what those sad songs say,Sad, sad songs they say.Make up your mind to be happy,Life is a merry-go-round.If an' you miss out this time,Don't let it fret your mind,Love will come round in the end.Makin' up your mind to be happyYou've gotta make up your mindMakin' up your mindMakin' up your mindMakin' up your mindMakin' up your mind...Make up your mind to be happy

VFrom the album fairytaleWe stood in the windy city,The gypsy boy and I.We slept on the breeze in the midnightWith the raindrop and tears in our eyes.And who's going to be the oneTo say it was no good what we done?I dare a man to say I'm too young,For I'm going to try for the sun.We huddled in a derelict buildingAnd when he thought I was asleepHe laid his poor coat round my shoulder,And shivered there beside me in a heap.And who's going to be the oneTo say it was no good what we done?I dare a man to say I'm too young,For I'm going to try for the sun.We sang and cracked the sky with laughter,Our breath turned to mist in the cold.Our years put together count to thirty,But our eyes told the dawn we were old.And who's going to be the oneTo say it was no good what we done ?I dare a man to say I'm too young,For I'm going to try for the sun.Mirror, mirror, hanging in the sky,Won't you look down what's happening here below?I stand here singing to the flowers,So very few people really know.And who's going to be the oneTo say it was no good what we done?I dare a man to say I'm too young,For I'm going to try for the sun.We stood in the windy cityThe gypsy boy and I.We slept on the breeze in the midnight,With the raindrop and tears in our eyes.And who's going to be the oneTo say it was no good what we done ?I dare a man to say I'm too young,For I'm going to try for the sun.

VCan ye dance with silver moonstepsOn the love couch of the sand?I will sing and play a fairy reelUpon a swany luteA tale of silver sandalsAnd an elf who loved to fishFor the twinkles in the evening wavesWith an oaken dishAs ye skip and spin and reelCan ye loose thy velvet bandAnd send thy mane atossingTo the kissing of the moonAnd as ye bid me enterThine eyes will open loveTo the allnesss of the smallnessAnd the starry sky above

VLady you are my peace of mindWere I to seek your par none I could findYou delicately went to curry landAnd left a lonely manAh me yogi blueHe thought to himself as he sat beforeHis stocks and shares a dreadful boreIf I'm to live another happy dayI best make haste and be on my wayOh me oh myHe at his desk did write and indicateTo lawyer friend and intimateHis lamentable grief did necessitateThe need for one swift bird to sail the ocean o'erA sailing schooner was soon seen sailingSwift and silent around the soundSalutating seagulls heraldingThe wonderous transport upon the wingTwenty days from Goa they did espieA wealthy merchant bound for Arabi-iyExchanging greetingsHad he heard the newsThe Lady Hall had drownedThe price of Ninevah roseStorms and tempests his shattered mind besetHurricanes of pains raged and toreTruly drowned in grief he did repairTo haunted trinkets and gross despairAll in white neath shadeIn bamboo chairMilitary disipline has replaced despairAnchored in the bay of innocenceIs left a lonely manLonely through and through

VOn the windy beach the sun is shining through withWeather fairWhite horses riding on the seas pasture onto theSandOver the Dunes came a travelling manSack on back Wild flowers in his handOld rusty cans, pebbles 'bedded in the sand standAnd stareScratching his beard through the grass he steeredHis sandy shoeDisappearing in the dips pondering and wanderingAlongNice as you please comes the travelling manDrinking a bottle of milk in his handSpeaking to no one in particular but happilyDown where young gulls dance driftwood lying dryingFor the fireYellow beak and sleek now the gulls are cryingFlying higherOut from the sea came a little green CrabTaking the Sun the morning being very drabOld rusty cans, pebbles 'bedded in the sand standAnd stareThe Tinker and the CrabThe Tinker and the CrabThe Tinker and the Crab

VOn the firefly platform on sunny Goodge StreetViolent hash-smoker shook a chocolate machineBobbed in an eating scene.Smashing into neon streets in their stillnessSmearing their eyes on the crazy Kali goddessListenin' to sounds of Mingus mellow fantastic."My, my", they sigh,"My, my", they sigh.In dull house rooms with coloured lights swingin'Strange music boxes sadly tinklin'Drink in the sun shining all around you."My, my", they sigh,"My, my", they sigh, mm mm."My, my", they sigh,"My, my", they sigh.The magician, he sparkles in satin and velvet,You gaze at his splendour with eyes you've not used yet.I tell you his name is Love, Love, Love."My, my", they sigh,"My, my", they sigh."My, my" - sigh

sS'Legend Of A Girl Child Linda'
p2963
VI will bring you gold apples and grapes made of rubiesThat have shone in the eyes of a prince of the breeze.Bright cascading crystals, they danced in the sand dunesOn the beach of no footprints to harpsichord tunes.A throne of white ivory, a gown of white laceLies still in the magic of a timeless place.One hundred small children, they laugh at the white dovesThat rest on their hands with the touch of love.On a hillside of velvet the children they lay downAnd make fun of the grown-ups with their silly frown.And the sound of their laughter is the sound of the green seaAs it washed around the foot of the seashell tree.The doves circle over and land in the treesWhere parrots are talking their words with such ease.Thus spoke three wizards to the young ones that day:"There's sadness in the kingdom, make it go far away."If you follow the sunbeams through the valley of flowersTo the palace of the White Queen with its white jade towers.The youngest, she sighed then the clouds drew awayAnd a hundred small fingers scratched their heads in dismay.>From out of the sun a giant gull came flyingAnd the children got ready to sit on its wings.They waved to the raindrops as they soared over the treesThe wind tossed their hair high, flashing gold on the sea.They came to the castle and there they did fall,And they saw all the sadness, through the crystal wall.A princess lay a-sleeping so gentle and kindWhilst her prince took to battle with his confused mind.The clash of bright metal brought the children fear,But their cloaks of blue satin dried up all of these tears.Thus children held hands and they spelled out their nameAll the golden children became a golden chain.It lies on a white throne in a magic placeWith a tunic of velvet and a gown of white lace.My sword, it lies broken and cast in a lakeIn a dream I was told that my princess would wake

All the lights were a t-t-twinkling on Snset,  I saw a sign in the sky  It said, "T-t-t-trip a t-trip, I trip,trip," I couldn't keep up up if I tried. Ah, we stepped down to reality company  To get some instant sleep  And the driver turned, I said, "Welcome back"  He smiled and he said, "Beep beep." What goes n? Chic-a-chick. What goes on? I really want to know. What goes on all around me, What goes on? I really want to know.When in should come-a my dream woman, She got sequins in her hair, Like she stepped out off a Fellini film, She sat in a white straw chair  But I thought I'd take a second look  Just to see what I could see  And my scene had popped out like  little bubble does, There was nobody there but me.  I sai, "Girl, you driunk a lot of drink-me, But you ain't in Wonderland  You know I might-a be there to greet you, child, When your trippin' ship touches the sand." What goes on? Chick-a-chick. What goes on I really want to know. What goes on? Chick-a-chick. What goes on I really want to know.A silver goblet of wine is-ato be  Held in a bejewelled glove  And the knights they toast the tournament, The falcons they fly above. And the queenwill drink of the dew tonight But the jester she cries alone, Because Merlin he spoke of an instant spell  To make the devil's white knights moan  And-a all and all, the seagull said, "As I look to where I've been, The whole human race  Has a-taken far too much Methedrine." What goes on? Chick-a-chick. What goes on? I really want to know. Whaaat goes on? So near  What goes on? I really want to know.Yeah well, come on.We sat in a velvet jewel case  With sparkles everywhere, And Julian sat on a diamond ring  And-a talked of the days gone by. We spoke of a common kaleidoscope  And the pros and the cons of Zen  And he spoke and-a said for a piece of cake  He really did have a yen.  Bobby Dylan he sat "the Mad Hatter", A broken hour glass in his hand, And-a Joannie sat in a white lace  Looking cool with a black lace fan. What goes on? chick-a-chick. What goes on? I really want to know. What goes on? Please tell me. What goes on? I really want to know.

VFrom the album slow down worldIt was up some laughing river where I'd gone to spend the day.I had such fantastic visions I could hardly stand to stay.And I stood within myself and suddenly felt free,And I stood above the burdens that puzzle you and me.I became awareness that was shared with all around,With the trees, the sky, the flowers, and the wind, the sun, the ground.I heard the birds were singing and I found them same as me,And I understood our sorrows and why they should not be.I saw this plane of living, it was nothing more than faith,A skin that covered glory, far beyond our love or hate,A living crystal fairyland where loving is our grace,A pyromanic garden that knows no time nor space.I saw what we've been doing to it, saw it as insane,Still a marching like good Christians with our wars, the sword, the flame,To crush all those damned infidels, defend what should be shame.And again I shared our sorrows and knew we all must bear the blame.I see it all as part of us to know and share alikeWith a universal willingness to know and do what's right,To understand our brotherness and stop this awful race,Let our children grow in peace, know their life shall not be waste.First there is a mountain, then it seems the mountain's gone,But then, if you take another look, why, it's been there all along.We can be just like that river as it laughs along its way,Or stand beneath the shadows that take the sun away.

VOnce in a town in the black forest a little white toy-shop stood.And the little tin soldier with only one leg lived in a castle of wood.And across the room on another shelf stood a little glass case,And a tiny ballerina lived in there all in her dress of lace.And from where the little tin soldier stood they could see each other so clearAnd the little tin soldier watched over her with a love that was so dear.Then one day sadness came: the tiny ballerina was sold.The little tin soldier was thrown away and into the gutter he rolled.The water carried him to the sea and many far-off lands.He made many children happy as he passed through their tiny hands.And then one day they met again in a house in the land of EireAnd when the clocks on the wall struck the midnight hourThey jumped into a fireAnd in that fire they shall stayForever in the day.For the fire, Lord, is the fire of love,Just like the peaceful dove.

V(Pete's theme) Only loveCan make it rainThe way the beach is kissed by the sea.Only loveCan make it rainLike the sweat of lovers'Laying in the fields.Love, reign o'er me.Love, reign o'er me, rain on me.Only loveCan bring the rainThat makes you yearn to the sky.Only loveCan bring the rainThat falls like tears from on high.Love Reign O'er me.On the dry and dusty roadThe nights we spend apart aloneI need to get back home to cool cool rain.The nights are hot and black as inkI can't sleep and I lay and I thinkOh God, I need a drink of cool cool rain.

VDeaf, dumb and blind boyHe's in a quiet vibration land.Strange as it seems, his musical dreamsAin't quite so bad.Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be.Loving life and becoming wiseIn simplicity.Sickness will surely take the mindWhere minds can't usually go.Come on the amazing journeyAnd learn all you should know.A vague haze of deliriumCreeps up on me.All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.He's dressed in a silver sparkledGlittering gownAnd his golden beard flowsNearly down to the ground.Nothing to say and nothing to hearAnd nothing to see.Each sensation makes a noteIn my symphony.Sickness will surely take the mindWhere minds can't usually go.Come on the amazing journeyAnd learn all you should know.His eyes are the eyes thatTransmit all they know.Sparkle warm crystalline glances to showThat he is your leaderAnd he is your guideOn the amazing journeyTogether you'll ride.

VThe old home town looks the same As I step down from the train,And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa.Down the road I look and there runs Mary Hair of gold and lips like cherries.It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.The old house is still standing tho' the paint is cracked and dry,And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on.Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary, Hair of gold and lips like cherries.It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.Then I awake and look around me, At four grey walls that surround me And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming.For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre,Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.Again I touch the green, green grass of home.Yes, they'll all come to see me In the shade of that old oak treeAs they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.

VSunset over the high-rise,By a motorway,A little man looks up at the sky.An uneventful end to a wasted day.Close-up on the man at the window,Looking at the street down below.It's obvious he's got things on his mind.He shakes his head, pulls down the blind.He start's writing a letter,To make it perfectly clear.He's just a man who's reached the end of his rope,Expressing his doubts and his fears.In a world, feels so lonely and afraid,Disillusioned by the promises they made,It's a pity that it ended up this way,Life is just a clichÈ.I'm gonna do tomorrowWhat I did yesterday.It's such a dull routine,Somebody cut this scene,It's such a boring clichÈ.Live life, day to day,Seems so passÈ.Everything you hear and say,Just another clichÈ.Like an actor on a movie screen,Living out someone else's dream.Living out a total misconception,Reality, a false perception.It's such a wasted life,Without any conclusion.Days drift into days,His life just slips away.People so blasÈ,Everything's a clichÈ.Yes it is.Yes it is.Just an illusion.Just an illusion.Moonlight over the high-rise,At the end of the day.The little man is asleep in his bed,Tucked up, safely away.In his dreams he's taken away by alien beings to anotherGalaxy, deep in space. To a planet where a man can liveOut his fantasies, and experience unimaginable pleasures.But morning comes and soon the realities of life willShatter his illusions, and the clichÈs of the world willBring him down. But still he's waiting for a change.Days drift into days,His life just slips away.Everything is passÈ,Everything's a clichÈ.Yes it is.Yes it is.Just an illusion.Just an illusion.Yes it is.Yes it is.See the sunlight over the motorway,The little man, with anger in his eyes,Stands by the window, looks at the sky.

VOne on the nose, one on the chin, You bruise so easy, so why stay with him? He uses you just like a human punching bag. But you don't complain, you're too scared to speak. Anyway, it only really hurts you when you laugh, And when you eat. But you can't break the pattern, week after week. The bruises show, But he must be special otherwise you'd just get up and go. You'll never let us know Exactly how you feel. What's the use, the cynics say it's no excuse, You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse. You say it's okay, But I say that it's not right. You wind him up, but you're living in fear, You keep going back but it ends in tears, oh. That's quite a cut on the side of your head. Is it from his fist, or did you really fall out of bed? Oh, so uncouth, Excuse me, is this your tooth? Why do you stay, no one knows. Do you really love him, or are you too scared to go? You're always nervous and on the edge of tears. You cry alone, But you never tell us what it's like when you get back home. No one will ever know Because you never show. What's the use, Everyone says you've got no excuse, You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse. You say it's okay, But I say that it's not right. Oh, it's your secret, it's your life, who am I to criticize? It takes two sides to know it's true, And maybe, he'll stay in love with you. No one will ever know, Because you never show.

VIn a deep dark jungle long time ago Lived a lonesome caveman He was a solitary soul And he spent his playtime Chewing meat from bones. He didn't know how to talk much He only knew how to groan Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky Let out a yell and no one replied. Frustration and torment tore him inside Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried. But then education saved the day. He learned to speak and communicate Education saved the day. He thanked God for the friends he made. Cause everybody needs an education Everybody needs an education. Black skin, red skin, yellow or white, Everybody needs to read and write Everybody needs an education. Thank the day when that primitive man Learned to talk with his brothers And live off the land. He left his cave and he moved far away And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made He learned to think and to work with his brain And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained He wrote it down on a rock that he found And he showed all his friends and they passed it around And then education came that day. The day it came was a sacred day. Education came that day He thanked God for the friends he'd made. Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail And he traveled far and wide Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky So he learned how to fly. Thanks to all the mathematicians And the inventors with their high I.Q.s And the professors in their colleges Trying to feed me knowledge That I know I'll never use. Thank you sir for the millions of words That you've handed me down and you've told me t

VThey put a parking lot on a piece of landWhere the supermarket used to stand.Before that they put up a bowling alleyOn the site that used to be the local palais.That's where the big bands used to come and play.My sister went there on a Saturday.Come dancing, All her boyfriends used to come and call.Why not come dancing, it's only natural?Another Saturday, another date.She would be ready but she'd always make him wait.In the hallway, in anticipation, He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.He'd end up blowing all his wages for the weekAll for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.Come dancing, That's how they did it when I was just a kid, And when they said come dancing, My sister always did.My sister should have come in at midnight, And my mum would always sit up and wait.It always ended up in a big rowWhen my sister used to get her own wayOut of my window I could see them in the moonlight, Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.The day they knocked down the palaisMy sister stood and cried.The day they knocked down the palaisPart of my childhood died, just died.Now I'm grown up and playing in a band, And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.My sister's married and she lives on an estate.Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.She knows they get away with things she never could, But if I asked her I wonder if she would, Come dancing, Come on sister, have yourself a ball.Don't be afraid to come dancing, It's only natural.Come dancing, Just like the palais on a Saturday.And all her friends will come dancingWhere the big bands used to play.

VA friend of mine just had a real bad time. You see, his life was shattered and he lost his mind. His girl ran off along with his best friend, And through emotional stress he brought his life to an end. It was such a tragedy, But that's the way it's got to be. Life goes on. Life goes on. It happens every day. So appreciate what you got Before it's taken away. Life will hit you When you're unprepared, So be grateful and take all That you can while you're there. Get that frown off your head, 'Cause you're a long time dead. Life goes on and on and on. Life goes on and on and on. No use runnin' 'round lookin' scared, Life could get you when you're unaware. One day it's gonna come, so you better accept it. Life will hit you when you least expect it. And one day when you are gone, You know that life will still go on. But no one'll care if you've been good, bad, right or wrong. Life will still go on. My bank went broke and my well ran dry. It was almost enough to contemplate suicide. I turned on the gas, but I soon realized I hadn't settled my bill so they cut off my supply. No matter how I try, it seems I'm too young to die. Life goes on and on and on. Life goes on and on and on. Tornado, cyclone and hurricane Can batter the houses with the thunder and rain. Blizzards can blow; the waves hit the shore, But the people recover and come back for more. Somehow the people fight back, even the future looks black. Life goes on and on and on. Life goes on and on and on.

VWhile the rich get their kicks with their affluent antics Mr. Black sits and ponders their fate. He just sits in the gloom of his dimly-lit room Waiting for them to swallow the bait. While the rich run their rackets he sits in his attic And casually clocks their defeat. While the politicians cover up mistakes that they've made And all the promises, the lies and deceits. A military coup has been long overdue. Now there's fighting and panic in the streets. Amid the mass disillusion, disorder and confusion, He will rise now his plan is complete. But me, I'm only standing here Watching it all go on and I'm watching it all go wrong And it's painfully clear that the battle is near And I wish I could just disappear. While Flash and his men drink champagne in their den And debase life with crude ostentation, The poor cry for more, but they're reaching the point Where the people can't stand any more. But me, I'm only standing here Watching it all go on, and I'm watching it all go wrong And it's painfully clear that the battle is near And I wish I could just disappear.

Up forlornly??I brewed another cuppa upAnd tried to sneak out early in the morning.I thought you had much better things to do,In Berkeley Mews I first met you,You drowned my conversation with champagne,And Berkeley Mews was not the same.I thought you were an intellect,But now that I reflect, you left me reeling.You made me drink a toastAnd when you finished I was looking at the ceiling.The flood of tears I've wept thinking of you,Remind me of that night in Berkeley Mews.You know that you left me broken hearted,Berkeley Mews.

VWho's that woman on your arm all dressed up to do you harm And I'm hip to what she'll do, give her just about a month or two. Bit off more than I can chew and I knew what it was leading to, Some things, well, I can't refuse, One of them, one of them the bedroom blues. She delivers right on time, I can't resist a corny line, But take the shine right off you shoes, Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues. Oo... In the bar you're getting drunk, I ain't in love, I ain't in luck. Hide the switch and shut the light, let it all come down tonight. Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger, Some face you'll never see no more. Let it all come down tonight. Keep those tears hid out of sight, let it loose, let it all come down.

VI'm the man on the mountain, come on up. I'm the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud. Yes, I'm fumbling and I know my car don't start. Yes, I'm stumbling and I know I play a bad guitar. Give me little drink from your loving cup. Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk. I'm the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun. I'm the man that brings you roses when you ain't got none. Well I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight You if you want to push and pull with me all night. Give me little drink from you loving cup. Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk. I feel so humble with you tonight, Just sitting in front of the fire. See your face dancing in the flame, Feel your mouth kissing me again, What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz, What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz. Oh, what a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz. Yes, I am nitty gritty and my shirt's all torn, But I would love to spill the beans with you till dawn. Give me little drink from your loving cup. Just one drink and I'll fall down drunk.

You choose your leaders and placeYour trust as their lies wash you down and their promises rust, you'llSee kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns.(repeat chorus)We talk and we walk until my head explodes, I turn on the news and myBody froze.

VPost office clerk puts up a sign saying "Position Closed" and secretariesTurn off typewriters and put on their coats.Janitors padlock the gates for security guards to patrol and bachelors phoneUp their friends for a drink while the married ones turn on a chat show andThey'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow.[CHORUS:]And Nothing Ever Happens, nothing happens at all, the needle returns to theStart of the song and we all sing along like before. And we'll all be lonelyTonight and lonely tomorrow.Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there, the Martians couldLand in the car park and no one would care. Closed circut cameras inDepartment stores shoot the same movie every day and the stars of theseFilms neither die nor get killed, just survive constant action replay.Repeat chorusBy five o'clock everything's dead and every third car is a cab. IgnorantPeople sleep intheir beds like the doped white mice in the college lab.[Repeat Chorus]

VYou thought the leaden winter would bring you down foever,But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.And the colors of the sea blind your eyes with trembling mermaids,And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses:How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing,For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white-lace lips.And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise,And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea.And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body,Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind.The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers,And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter.Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell,And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sandsWith the tales of brave Ulysses: how his naked ears were torturedBy the sirens sweetly singing.The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers,And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter.

The angels repliedOh, your baby has gone down the plug hole.Oh, your baby has gone down the plug.The poor little thing was so skinny and thin,He should have been washed in a jug, in a jug.Your baby is perfectly happy;He won't need a bath anymore.He's a-muckin' about with the angels above,Not lost but gone before.Do you want to do it again?

p5742
VComing to me in the morning, leaving me at night.Coming to me in the morning, leaving me alone.You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard.Running to me a-cryin' when he throws you out.Running to me a-cryin', on your own again.You've got that pure feel, such good responses,But the picture has a mustache.You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face,Coming looking like you've never ever done one wrong thing.You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face.You're coming looking like you've never ever done one wrong thing.So many fantastic colors; I feel in a wonderland.Many fantastic colors makes me feel so good.You've got that pure feel, such good responses.You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard.

sS'Anyone For Tennis'
p5744
VTwice upon a time in the valley of tearThe auctioneer is bidding for a box of fading yearsAnd the elephants are dancing on the graves of squealing mice.Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?And the ice creams are all melting on the streets of bloody beerWhile beggars stain the pavement with fluorescent Christmas cheerAnd the Bentley driving guru is putting up his price.Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?And the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hopeWith jingle bells and fairy tales and blind colliding scopesAnd you can tell they're all the same underneath the pretty lies.Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?The yellow Buddhist monk is burning brightly at the zooYou can bring a bowl of rice and a glass of water tooAnd fate is setting up the chessboard while death rolls out the dice.Anyone for tennis, wouldn't the be nice?

sS'Passing The Time'
p5746
VIt is a cold winter,Away is the songbird.And gone is her traveller,She waits at home.The sun is on holiday,No leaves on the trees.The animals sleepWhile cold North wind blows.The snowflakes are falling,The roof a white blanket.There's ice on the window pane,She waits alone.She sits by the fireside,The room is so warm.Her children are sleeping,She waits in their home.Passing the time.Passing the time.Everything fine.Passing the time, drinking red wine.Passing the time, drinking red wine.Passing the time, drinking red wine.Passing the time, everything fine.Passing the time, drinking red wine.Passing the time, everything fine.Passing the time, wine and time rhyme.Passing the time.It is a long winter,Away is the summer.She waits for her travellerSo far from home.She sits by the fireside,The room is so warm.There's ice on the window,She's lonely alone.

VI went down to the crossroads, fell down on my kneesDown to the crossroads, down on my kneesAsked the Lord above for mercy, save me if you pleaseI went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a rideDown to the crossroads, tried to flag a rideNobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me byAnd I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my sideGoing down to Rosedale, take my rider by my sideYou can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riversideGoing down to Rosedale, take my rider by my sideGoing down to Rosedale, take my rider by my sideYou can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riversideYou can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie BrownYou can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie BrownAnd I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down

p5754
VPressed Rat and Warthog have closed down their shop.They didn't want to, 'twas all they had got.Selling atonal apples, amplified heat, And Pressed Rat's collection of dog legs and feet.Sadly they left, telling no one goodbye.Pressed Rat wore red jodhpurs, Warthog a striped tie.Between them they carried a three-legged sack, Went straight round the corner and never came back.The bad captain madman had ordered their fate.He laughed and stomped off with a nautical gait.The gait turned into a deroga tree, And his peg-leg got woodworm and broke into three.Pressed Rat and Warthog have closed down their shop.They didn't want to, 'twas all they had got.Selling atonal apples, amplified heat, And Pressed Rats collection of dog legs and feet.
