1,The Beatles,Across The Universe,"Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which  
Dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless undying love, which  
Shines around me like a million suns,  
It calls me on and on across the universe

An orphan's home one day,  
I stopped for just a little while  
To watch the children play.  
Alone a boy was standing  
And when I asked him why,  
He turned with eyes that could not see  
And he began to cry.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.  
Just like the flowers  
I'm growing wild.  
I got no mummy's kisses  
I got no daddy's smile.  
Nobody wants me,  
I'm nobody's child.  
  
No mummy's arms to hold me  
Or sue me when I cry,  
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome  
I wish that I could die.  
I'll walk the streets of heaven  
Where all blinds can see.  
  
And just like for the other kids  
It will be a home for me.  
  
I'm nobody's child,  
I'm nobody's child.

Respect yourself

Your letters threw them on the fire  
Your pictures out the window  
All that I could find that reminded me of you  
I threw them all away  
  
I get up in the morning  
I'm pacing the floor  
Like I'm expecting you to walk in the door  
I keep forgetting I won't see you anymore  
Guess I'm doomed to be chained to a memory  
  
Oh, yes I am  
I get up in the morning  
I'm pacing the floor  
Like I'm expecting you to walk in the door  
I keep forgetting I won't see you anymore  
Guess I'm doomed to be chained to a memory  
Yes I am

43,Dusty Springfield,Come Back To Me,"Hear my voice  
Where you are  
Take a train  
Steal a car  
Hop a freight  
Grab a star  
Come back to me  
  
Catch a plane  
Catch a breeze  
On your hands  
On your knees  
Swim or fly  
Darling please  
Come back to me  
  
On your mark  
Now get set  
Hop a mule  
Hop a jet  
In a towel wringing wet  
I don't care  
This is where you should be  
  
From the hills to the shore  
Ride the wind to my door  
Turn the highways to dust  
Break the law if you must  
Move the world  
Only just come back to me  
  
Must I yell 'til I'm blue?  
Where are you and will you  
Come back to me?  
Have you gone to the moon  
Or the corner saloon?  
In Rome or Rangoon  
I'm a wreck  
Where in heck can you be?  
  
In a crate  
In a trunk  
Half asleep  
Roaring drunk  
In a rolls or a van  
Anyway that you can  
I'd be so nice to come home to  
Lover come back  
Come back to me

Waiting all alone  
Think about what you can give  
Some boys never learn

It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
To keep the one you love by your side  
  
A woman's work is never done  
Never stops, it goes on and on  
You work your fingers to the bone

Sometimes the going gets a little tough  
Seems like my best ain't good enough  
Keeps you losing sleep  
Seven days a week, yeah

To keep the man you love satisfied  
It ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy  
To keep the one you love by your side  
  
To keep him happy  
You must sacrifice  
Be ready and willing  
To spend lonely nights  
Do what you can  
Though he seems ungrateful  
Love him so true  
Even though he seems unfaithful  
  
But when his hope is gone  
And life gets him down  
That's when he'll say  
He needs you around  
  
Hard to live with him  
Hard to live without him  
It ain't easy, no  
  
Oh, yeah, it ain't easy  
Girls it ain't easy

They need our love and care  
No matter when we gotta be right there  
In between the crying  
Gotta keep trying

Now that I know I'm losing you  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
And no matter what you do  
You're still a part of me  
Even though I'm losing you, oh  
  
How many years will go by  
Before my heart begins to mend  
Waiting and wondering why  
I never thought our love could end  
  
I try forgetting you  
But you're still here on my mind  
It would take a miracle  
But someday maybe I'll find  
  
That I'm in the loving arms of someone  
That I'll know, know he's the someone  
Who'll kiss all the heartache away  
And come that day  
I won't mind losing you  
  
Yes, I try forgetting you  
But you're still here on my mind  
It would take, yeah, a miracle  
But someday maybe I'll find  
  
That I'm in the loving arms of someone  
That I'll know, know he's the someone  
Who'll kiss all the heartache away  
And when he comes to me that day  
I won't mind losing you, oh, oh  
I won't mind losing you, yeah  
I won't mind losing you

62,Dusty Springfield,Losing You (Track,"(Elvis Costello)  
  
Layin' about, lying in bed  
Maybe it was somethin' I thought I said  
With the tempo of the damned, the temptation of tomorrow  
I don't know if I can give you anything but sorrow  
  
They stay alive this late on Radio Five  
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth  
But the moments that I care about are moments that I treasure  
Better take another measure for pleasure  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
I count the pages of the letter I write  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine  
Tearin' up the sheets of love this hand could not disguise  
I'll start to count again and close my eyes  
  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you  
Is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Now you're here  
I'm here too  
Can be this easy for me and you  
  
Now you're here  
I'm here too  
Be this easy for me and you

Memories don't mean that much to me

63,Dusty Springfield,Lost,"I was a sad and lonely girl  
All alone in this big world, baby, (hey, baby) baby  
Lost in a state of misery  
Not a soul to comfort me, baby (hey, baby)  
  
I couldn't find no help  
Didn't know what to do with myself  
Oh, I was standing in confusion  
So badly disillusioned  
When you wrapped your arms around me  
I knew love had found me  
  
I was lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
You know I was lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
Oh, I was lost  
  
I thank the lord that you  
Are the one who came to my rescue, baby, (hey, baby)  
Thanks for me and this heart of mine  
You came just in time, baby, baby (hey, baby)  
  
I couldn't find my way, ooh  
Don't you hear what I say?, yeah  
Well I was standing in confusion  
So badly disillusioned  
When you wrapped your arms around me  
I knew love had found me  
  
I was lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
You know I was lost (so lost), yeah  
But found in the nick of time  
Well, I was out here in desperation  
No means of communication  
Just looking for a sign  
Then you threw out your lifeline  
  
Lost, so long  
But found in the nick of time  
You know I was lost (so lost), yes I was  
But found in the nick of time  
Well, I was out here in desperation

64,Dusty Springfield,Love Shine Down,"Ooh, hoo, once love was a fire  
That came and lit my way  
I felt the fire die about a month ago  
And now I look at my man  
And I know he's goin' away  
And now, I want that man  
Mmm, I need that man  
And I got to get back into his heart  
I said love shine down on me  
Love shine down on me  
Love shine, light my way back into his heart  
I, I stood beside him  
When nobody else, nobody wanted to  
Well I've been down, yes I have  
But I've never, never been broken  
'Til the day that he told me  
The sweet lovin' life was through  
I said, I want that man  
Ooh, I need that man  
And I got to get back into his heart

65,Dusty Springfield,Make It With You,"Ah, ha, have you ever tried  
Really reaching out for the other side?  
I may be climbing up rainbows  
But baby, here goes  
Oh, dreams, they're for those who sleep  
Life is for us to keep  
And if you're wonderin' what this all is leadin' to  
I want to make it with you  
I really think that we could make it, ooh  
  
No, you don't know me well  
And every little thing only time will tell  
But you believe the things that I do  
And we'll see it through  
Oh, life can be short or long

66,Dusty Springfield,Mama's Little Girl,"Took the ribbon from my hair  
And I'm letting it all hang down  
So, if you're lookin' for the same old me  
Gotta tell you that she's left town  
Don't try to call my number, baby  
You're gonna get no reply  
'Cause suddenly I'm changin'  
I'm finally rearrangin'  
  
In this day of liberation  
I'm lookin' to find my share  
What's the use of being patient?  
You ain't goin' nowhere  
I got my own two-step together  
And I want the first slow dance with you  
I just saw Venus risin'  
Guess I'm realisin'  
  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
And baby, you're the first to know  
I ain't mama's little girl no more  
I took a little time to grow  
It's gonna be worth waiting  
The anticipating  
I'm not mama's little baby no more  
  
Well, I've been everyone's best friend  
Someone they could tell their troubles to  
How come they never noticed me  
And the pain that I was going through?  
I've seen the lonely side of living  
I never want to go back there again  
The sad old me is dyin'  
Tonight there is no denyin'  
  
I ain't mama's little girl no more

67,Dusty Springfield,Meditation,"In my loneliness  
When you're gone and I'm all by myself  
And I need your caress  
I just think of you  
And the thought of you holding me near  
Makes my loneliness soon disappear  
  
Though you're far away  
I have only to close my eyes  
And you are back to stay  
I just close my eyes  
And the sadness that missing you brings  
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings  
  
Yes I love you so  
And that for me is all I need to know  
I will wait for you  
Till the stars fall from out of the sky  
But what else can I do?  
I will wait for you  
Meditating how sweet it'll be  
When you come back to me  
  
Just the memory of your little smile  
Makes everything worthwhile  
You're so right for me  
There could never be anyone new  
Could thrill me the way that you do  
No, I won't forget  
For though you're gone I feel your nearness yet  
  
Oh, I will wait for you  
'Til the stars fall from out of the sky  
But what else can I do?  
I will wait for you  
Meditating how sweet love will be  
When you come back to me

68,Dusty Springfield,Mixed Up Girl,"Ah, ha, ah  
Gonna let you go, my angel  
Though I could make you stay  
I could use my blind self-pity  
Throw it in your way  
But the times have turned between us  
And you know I don't believe  
That it makes one bit of difference  
If you stay or if you leave  
  
Why can't I be lonely  
Like that lonely rushing river?  
Pushing down a mountain  
On it's way to meet the sea  
  
Why can't I need somebody  
Like that river needs that ocean?  
Why did you have to get so mixed up, baby?  
With a mixed up girl  
With a mixed up girl like me, yeah  
  
Gonna make it short now, angel  
Though I could make it long  
I could take through all the changes  
And show you where you're wrong  
  
But our dreams don't flow together  
And you'll never, never see the light  
So it really, really doesn't matter  
Who is wrong or who is right?  
Oh, why can't I be lonely  
Like that lonely rushing river?  
It's pushing down the mountain  
On its way to meet the sea  
  
Oh, why can't I need somebody  
Like that river needs that ocean?  
Why did you have to get so mixed up, baby  
With a mixed up girl

70,Dusty Springfield,No Easy Way Down,"With the music of life, my soul is out of tune,  
And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,  
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,  
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims  
I got distracted with meaningless games,  
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,  
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.  
Now I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.  
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,  
Doomed to find out things a little too late,  
And so I must play this broken man's role,  
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.  
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,  
I've got a heart that has no hope,  
All my senses are numb,  
Losing you, I've become,  
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream,  
Without a dream,  
Without a dream.

And believe

All that you were dreaming  
And believe

Will descend on you en masse  
So what I'm saying, baby  
Is believe

On the way, will I find it somehow?  
  
Yesterday's gone  
Love lead me on, oh

Give us this night, oh

73,Dusty Springfield,Sandra,"She's a great little housewife  
Though sometimes she talks like a fool  
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush  
And she picks up the kids after school  
And she puts down the 'phone  
When her husband comes home  
And she changes from mother to wife  
'Til she feels the words hanging between them  
And she hangs by her words to her life  
  
She says  
I swear I love my husband  
I love my kids  
I wanted to be like my mother  
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did  
Oh, there might have been time to be me for myself, for myself  
So many things that she wishes  
She don't even know what she's missing  
And that's how she knows that she missed  
  
She's a sweetheart except when she's moody  
It's hard to get through to her then  
Depressed for a while when the youngest was born  
Ah, but that happens now and again  
Ah, she might take a drink with the housework  
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop  
A martini or two before dinner  
But she always knows when to stop  
  
She says  
I swear I love my husband  
And I love my kids  
And, though I wanted to be like my mother

Now it's seldom, if ever, they go  
Once you pay for the sitter, and parking the car  
There's no money left for the show  
She was doing the dishes  
When a glass fell and broke on the tile  
And she cut her wrist, quite by mistake  
It was real touch and go for a while  
  
She says  
Oh God, I love my husband  
And I love my kids  
Well, I wanted to be like my mother  
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did

To last my whole life through, yeah  
It's all for you  
  
There's so few men nowadays  
Who understand the soul of a woman  
Now they're always on the take, and they're  
Never giving, never offering a helping hand  
Oh baby, I can count on you  
Whenever trouble calls  
You see me through  
You show your love in so many ways  
I'm gonna love you for the rest of my days, yeah  
  
I got so much love to give you  
Baby, I got so much love to give you  
Oh, there's more than enough  
To last my whole life through, oh yeah  
It's all for you  
  
(So much love)  
It's gonna last my whole life through

Yes it is  
Just say it, baby, baby, baby  
So many days  
So many ways

79,Marianne Faithfull,A Waste Of Time,"Another waste of time  
Another sort of step along the way  
A waste of time  
A waste but an interest in delay  
Was it all of a waste  
Or was it fun  
People fly far away  
  
A waste of time  
Almost not too clear a lesson not to play  
Exercice perhaps in sensual decay  
Hard to love and to see how the land lay  
How to love, what to say  
  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing left to say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing left to say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing, nothing left to say  
  
A waste of time  
At least some company along the way  
Great visions  
Perhaps too fast too bright but anyway  
And I'll be what you be  
You wanna say  
You think you wanna say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing left to say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing left to say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing, nothing left to say  
  
How to love and to see how the land lay  
How to laugh, what to say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing left to say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing left to say  
Gliding across thin ice  
With nothing, nothing left to say

80,Marianne Faithfull,After The Ceasefire,"After the ceasefire that they swore would last  
She had the bright idea: ""To hell with the past!""  
That's where love lay bleeding, licking at its wounds  
The times were never changing, sticking to their guns  
She thought she really meant it, that's the honest truth  
She felt it in her marrow, she felt it in her boots  
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire  
  
The man she married, he was something else  
He adored the chaos, smashing all the delft  
The man she married, he was something else  
He had the sudden notion it's time to call a truce  
It's time to lead a quiet life for the love of Jesus  
Let's sit down together, and engage in talks of peace  
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire  
  
He was Irish Catholic, she had English blood  
They met in a good restaurant, they gave the secret nod  
She ordered fish and lentils, he the kidney stew  
She played with bold impulses, wine turned his lips blue  
They left in separate taxis to the same address  
In case someone was watching, and there they did confess  
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire  
  
It was all the others' fault, they thought at any rate  
After the ceasefire to put an end to hate  
She was reaching for her knife, he a fork and spoon  
They sat about devouring the poison of the moon  
Shared a fatal cigarette neither one would light  
Their breath was flame enough, nobody said goodnight  
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire  
  
After the ceasefire that they swore would last  
They had the strange idea of living in the past  
That's where love lies bleeding, licking at its wounds  
The times are never changing, sticking to their guns  
They sit about devouring the poison of the moon  
The times were never singing the same tune  
After the ceasefire [Repeat: x4]

Smiling faces I can see  
But not for me,

My riches can't buy everything,  
I want to hear the children sing.  
All I hear is the sound  
Of rain falling on the ground,  
I sit and watch as tears go by.

Doing things I used to do

In this world of trouble and pain

Tell me where did you sleep last night ?  
In the pines, in the pines  
Where the sun never shines  
And I shivered the whole night long.  
Tell me where did you get that pretty little dress  
And those shoes that you wear so fine ?  
I got my dress from a railroad man  
And my shoes from a driver deep in the mine.

84,Marianne Faithfull,Blazing Away,"So searching down and out looking for a place to stay  
A place of no commitment, a place with no involvement.  
I got one eye on insanity, the other on the wheel,  
One's turning, one's burning, blazing away.  
One's turning, one's burning, blazing away.  
  
Strange-looking exile with a passion for the dangerous,  
An eye for the wicked, a tongue for the nasty.  
I got one eye on insanity, the other on the wheel,  
One's turning, one's burning, blazing away.  
One's turning, one's burning, blazing away.  
  
What is the reason that things change?  
What is the reason they can never stay the same?  
What can I do, what can I do?  
Feel it, release it, things change.  
  
Feel it, release it, things change.

86,Marianne Faithfull,Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,"I walk along the street of sorrow  
The boulevard of broken dreams  
Where gigolo and gigolette  
Can take a kiss without regret  
So they forget their broken dreams.  
  
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow  
When you behold your shattered schemes.  
And gigolo and gigolette  
Wake up to find their eyes are wet  
With tears that tell of broken dreams.  
  
Here is where you'll always find me,  
Always walking up and down,  
But I left my soul behind me  
In an old cathedral town.  
  
The joy that you find here, you borrow,  
You cannot keep it long it seems.  
But gigolo and gigolette  
Still sing a song and dance along  
The boulevard of broken dreams.  
  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

You're a brain drain, you go on and on like a blood stain.  
You're a drain brain, you go on and on like a blood stain.

If a thing ain't worth having, you're having to pay.

Got so much to offer, but I can't pay the rent,

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?  
In the park or walking down the high way,

A bottle of gin and a cigarette was all what he had left.  
Well, I know that you make music 'cause you carry a guitar,  
But God help the troubadour who tries to be a star.  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on and play the chords of love, my friend,  
Play the chords of fame,  
But if you want to keep your song, do mi, do mi do,  
Don't play the chords of fame, oh no, no.  
  
You know I've seen my share of hustlers as they try to take the world  
And when they find a melody, they're surrounded by the girls.  
But it all fades so quickly like a sunny summer day,  
Reporters ask you questions and they write down what you say.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They'll rob you of your innocence, and put you up for sale.  
The more that you will find success, the more that you will fail.  
I've been around, I've had my share, and I really can't complain,  
But I wonder who I left behind on the other side of fame.

92,Marianne Faithfull,Don't Make Promises,"It seems the songs we're singing  
Are all about tomorrow,  
Tunes of promises that we can't keep.  
Every moment bringing

You're telling me lies in your sleep.  
  
Do you think I'm not aware  
Of what you're saying  
Or why you're saying it?  
Is it hard to keep me where  
You want me staying?  
Don't go on betraying.  
  
Don't make promises that you can't keep.  
  
We had a chance to find it,  
Our time was now or never,  
You promised me things that I need.  
And then the things behind it  
Took away the chance forever,  
You're telling me lies in your sleep.  
  
Do you think I'm not aware  
Of what you're saying  
Or why you're saying it?

But I being young and foolish,

My love and I did stand.  
And on my healing shoulder

100,Marianne Faithfull,He'll Come Back To Me,"Do you hear  
What I hear,  
Or can I have been deceived ?  
Voices singing,  
Bells are ringing,  
They say  
He'll come back to me.  
  
Though he's gone,  
In my sleep  
As if he were here with me,  
He'll be back now,  
I can tell now,  
You'll see,  
He'll come back to me.  
  
Once more, once more,  
Tell me that he's still sure.  
I know, I know  
That he loves me much more  
And I'll be here waiting  
Until he comes back to me.  
  
There's one thing  
You should know:  
Just how much I love him so.  
Though he hurt me,  
He won't desert me,  
And now  
He'll come back to me.

Who is that person in the mirror? it's not me.  
Whatever happened to the one that I used to be?  
Is she just another fading memory?

There is a house in New Orleans,  
They call it the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin  
Of many poor girl,  
And me, oh god, I'm one.  
  
If I had listened  
To what my mother said  
I'd've been at home today.  
But I was young and foolish, oh god,  
Let a rambler lead me astray.  
  
Go tell my baby sister  
Don't do what I have done.  
Go shun that house in New Orleans  
They call the risin' sun.  
  
Well, I'm going back to New Orleans,  
My race is almost run.  
I'm going back to spend my life  
In the house of the risin' sun.

If he's been looking for me.  
There was a time blue eyes said he'd love no other,

And the force you've been weary

In the factory  
How they made you  
And they made me  
  
Made of ideas  
Made to think and feel  
Do you feel too much?  
Do you feel too real?  
  
You're so full of life  
What do you want with mine?  
How I loved you once  
How I loved you twice  
  
Did I have to pay  
Such a heavy price?  
How I loved you more  
Than my own life  
  
Just to be  
You and me  
Almost real  
Almost free  
  
It's hard to believe  
In the factory  
How the satin feels  
And the diamonds gleam  
  
How they made our eyes  
Made our hearts and minds  
How they built us to  
Leave it all behind  
  
Just to be  
You and me  
Almost real  
Almost free  
  
Just to be  
You and me  
Almost real

Fatigue I feel it, too.  
I guess I never thought I had a thing or two to lose,  
I never thought I'd end up as good news.

Concede to what you fear.  
And if you think that I have so much love to go to waste,  
Cut out the running home, make the pace.

111,Marianne Faithfull,"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue","You must leave now  
Take what you need, you think will last  
But whatever you wish to keep  
You'd better grab it fast  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun  
Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are coming through  
And it's all over now, baby blue  
The highway is for gamblers  
Better use your sense  
Take what you have  
Gathered from coincidence  
The empty-handed painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky, too, is folding under you  
And it's all over now, baby blue  
All your seasick sailors  
They are rowing home  
Your empty-handed  
Armies are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet, too, is moving under you  
And it's all over now, baby blue  
Leave your stepping stones behind you  
Something calls for you  
Forget the dead you've left  
They will not follow you  
The vagabond who's rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match, go start anew  
And it's all over now, baby blue

Every tick and tussle  
Heart torn because it's a kissin' time.  
  
So pass on by  
You'll never find out  
I love someone else  
Find your God  
You'll find yourself  
But, he falls  
I'm confessing to you  
Just my guess  
It's a kissin' time.

Oh no, I see far right through you.  
  
Please understand my kissin' song  
Think for yourself,  
It's a lesson, guess it's kissin' time.  
Heart torn because  
Parts of me I'd sell myself  
Oh, just in time I'm assessing myself.

Keep on, hold me

Knife in hand.

Poor wee Jenny,

One old flower.  
  
Hey there, Mackie,  
How is she cuttin' ?  
Have another,  
Hold your hour.

Chemicals flying, oh I love this.  
What's it all for if you can't feel the ecstasy?  
What's it all for if you can't touch the power,  
The will to live in the hour ?  
Don't steal what I have got, baby,  
'Cause it's hardly enough for myself.  
Don't steal what I've got, baby,  
'Cause the balance is thin like a shell.  
I cherished the night of your marathon kiss,  
Chemicals flying, oh I love this.  
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment?  
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment,  
The moment of kiss.  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless when I'm with you.  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless through and through.  
What am I gonna wear? I don't care.  
Nobody sees the inside.  
Oh, the radio's gonna take us out  
Take us out on a ride.  
I put on perfume and I walk in the room  
The world stands still with you in the room.  
I cross the floor and I'm high and I'm rich  
When I'm under your lips and your fingertips.  
I cherished the night of your marathon kiss,  
Chemicals flying into the mist.  
What's it all for if you can't feel the moment?  
What's it all for if you can't feel the power?  
What's it all for if you can't, can't live right here  
In the hour, in the hour, in the hour?  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless when I'm with you.  
Fearless when I'm with you,  
Fearless through and through.

115,Marianne Faithfull,Misplaced Love,"You noticed that I closed my eyes again  
And smiled in all the silence  
I have grown in me for you.  
But then, what accident of stars  
Brought you so late into my arms  
Where even now another sleeps ?  
Here in my heart I know that you and I are one.  
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on  
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on  
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on  
At all our misplaced love, all our misplaced love.  
  
You noticed that I turned my head away  
And cried for all the goodness  
I have found deceiving you.  
Ah well, how could we know the hand  
Fate chose to be our guide was tired  
Of lover's bliss and holding hands  
And deep in my heart I know that you and I are one.  
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've done  
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've done  
I wonder if some joker sighs for what we've done  
With all our misplaced, all our misplaced love.  
  
I noticed that you touched my soul in time  
And lied to stop my leaving  
For a place where no one hears.  
But then what randomness and chance  
Could move the mountain from our dreams,  
Or break the spell upon us now ?  
And though deep in my heart I know you and I are one  
I wonder if the joker dies what will become  
I wonder if the joker dies what will become  
I wonder if the joker dies what will become  
Of all our misplaced love.  
  
All our misplaced love.

A throwaway from an open grave  
Cut you loose from a chain gang  
And let you go  
  
And on the day you said it's true  
Some love holds and some gets used  
Tried to tell you I never knew  
It could be so sweet  
Who could ever be so cruel,  
Blame the devil for the things you do.  
It's such a selfish way to lose  
The way you lose these wasted blues,

When the moon is a counterfeit  
Better find the one that fits  
Better find the one that lights  
The way for you.  
  
When the road is full of nails,  
Garbage pails and darkened jails  
And their tongues are full of heartless tales  
That drain on you  
Who would ever notice you  
You fade into a shaded room ?  
It's such a selfish way to lose  
The way you lose these wasted blues  
These wasted blues.

Tell me, sister morphine, when are you coming round again?  
Oh, I don't think I can wait that long  
Oh, you see that I'm not that strong  
  
The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears  
Tell me, sister morphine, how long have I been lying here?  
What am I doing in this place?  
Why does the doctor have no face?  
  
Oh, I cant crawl across the floor

123,Marianne Faithfull,Something Better,"He walks along singing his fairy song  
Picking up magic that grows at his feet.  
She says the same her peculiar way  
Dreaming good fortune on everyone's street.  
Say, hey, have you heard, blue whiskey's the rage,  
I'll send you a jug in the morning.  
  
It is absurd to live in a cage,  
You know there's got to be something better.  
As they go by, don't look with eagle's eyes  
Smile on your jailers until they grow weak.  
Nothing can compare to something that's almost there  
To tear up the madness that all of us seek.

Oh how I've waited so long  
For summer nights.  
When there's magic in the air  
And I don't have a care,  
All that matters to me  
Is that you are here  
On summer nights.  
  
There's a little cafe  
Where we can hear music play.  
They keep the lights turned down low  
It's a place where lovers go.  
There you'll hold me tight and say  
Our love will always be this way  
On summer nights.  
  
At the end of the day  
We can go down to the bay  
And together hand in hand  
We will walk along the sand  
On summer nights.  
  
In our little cafe  
We'll dance the night away  
And we know our love will be  
Always true eternally.  
  
And when the moon begins to shine  
I can see that you are mine  
On summer nights.  
  
On summer nights.  
On summer nights.

129,Tom Jones,Ain't That A Lot Of Love,"I know the desert can't hold all the love  
that I feel in my heart for you  
If I could spread it out across the sea,  
I know my love would cork it up  
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
  
If the bees only knew how sweet you are baby  
They would seal up their honeycomb  
If the birds could hear how sweet your voice is  
They would tighten up the song  
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
Your lips are so sweet, honey you're my every need  
You got a smile so rare  
A love like yours I just can't compare  
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
Ain't that a lot of love for one heart to hold  
  
If the cook in the kitchen had a touch as hot as yours  
They wouldn't need a fire  
I can't think of a word that describes you better  
Than the sight of her

"
130,Tom Jones,Behind Closed Doors,"My baby makes me proud, Lord, don't she make me proud  
She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd  
'Cause people like to talk, Lord, don't they love to talk  
But when they turn out the lights, I know she'll be leaving with me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
And she lets her hair hang down  
And she makes me glad that I'm a man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
  
My baby makes me smile, Lord, don't she make me smile  
She's never far away or too tired to say I want you  
She's always a lady, just like a lady should be  
But when they turn out the lights, she's still a baby to me  
  
And when we get behind closed doors  
And she lets her hair hang down  
And she makes me glad that I'm a man  
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors  
Behind closed doors

When tears are in your eyes  
I'll dry them all  
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough  
And friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Sail on, silver girl, sail on by  
Your time has come to shine  
All your dreams are on their way  
See how they shine....  
Ooooh, and if you ever need a friend  
I'm sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind.......

133,Tom Jones,"Brother, Can You Spare A Dime","Once I built a railroad, made it run  
Made it race against time  
Once I built a railroad, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime  
  
Once I built a tower, to the sun  
Bricks, rivet, and lime  
Once I built a tower, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime  
  
Once in cocky suits  
Gee, we looked swell  
Full of that Yankee Doodle-dom  
Half a million boots, they went  
Slogging through Hell  
And I, I was a kid with a drum  
  
Say, don't you remember  
They called me Al  
It was Al all the time  
Say, don't you remember  
I'm your pal  
Buddy, can you spare a dime

134,Tom Jones,Daughter Of Darkness,"Woman, I can remember a woman  
Warm were her kisses and tender was she  
Lying there in my arms  
Why, why did you deceive me so  
What devil inside made you go  
When I needed you most of all  
  
Daughter of darkness  
Stay out of my life, my life  
You took my heart, you broke it apart  
Daughter of darkness  
Daughter of darkness  
Please leave me alone forever  
Daughter of darkness gone is the love  
That we shared together  
  
Heaven, we had our own kind of heaven  
Sharing together, the magic of love  
In a world of our own  
Then oh so suddenly you were gone  
The love I depended upon disappeared when you went away  
  
Daughter of darkness stay out of my life, my life  
You took my heart, you broke it apart  
Oh daughter of darkness

135,Tom Jones,Do I Ever Cross Your Mind,"Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked  
Long ago in the sweet used to be  
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet  
As they did when you picked them for me  
  
[Chorus]  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever think back on old memories like that  
Or do I ever cross your mind  
  
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night  
Because you miss me, do you darling  
Oh, and do your memories ever take  
You back into another place in time  
And do you ever miss the feelings  
And the love we shared when you were with me, tell me darling  
Or do I ever cross your mind  
  
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss  
Your sweet lips like I did long ago  
And how often I long for those two loving arms  
That once held me so gentle and close

Pull out the front, don't give me no sass  
Take your foot slap it on the floor  
When you get ahead we'll rock some more  
  
Oh! the way is dark

139,Tom Jones,Green Green Grass Of Home,"The old home town looks the same  
As I step down from the train,  
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa.  
Down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.  
  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
The old house is still standing tho' the paint is cracked and dry,  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on.  
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary,  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Then I awake and look around me,  
At four grey walls that surround me  
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming.  
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre,  
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.  
Again I touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.

Could never buy what I can give

And then let's really start to live  
  
My heart has love enough for two  
More than enough for me and you  
I'm rich with love, a millionaire

Why don't you take a share  
  
Just help yourself to my lips to my arms  
Just say the word and they're yours  
Just help yourself to the love in my heart  
Your smile has opened up the door  
The greatest wealth that exists in the world  
Could never buy what I can give  
Just help yourself to my lips to my arms  
And then let's really start to live

142,Tom Jones,I Wanna Get Back With You,"I was a fool to say the things I said,  
I just lost my head.  
Made you cry, made you go,  
I didn't mean to be so cold.  
I had no right mistreating you that way  
And oh, how could I know the price I'd pay?  
Sorry I ever caused you pain.  
Sorry I, sorry I said those hurtful things.

I wanna get back with you.  
Just give me one more try.  
I wanna get back with you.  
I gotta get back with you.  
Just stop this hurt inside.

I been walking down these cold and lonely streets.  
Had to prove I was strong but every night,  
Every night just proved me wrong.  
Had to think I had heaven right here in my hand  
And oh, just let it slip away like sand.  
One more chance, one more chance back in your light.  
Oh, gimme one chance to make it right.  
I wanna get back with you.  
'Cause baby, all that really matters now is  
Hold me just like before.  
I wanna get back with you.  
Taking me somewhere warm.  
I gotta get back with you.  
Baby, I'd give my soul  
Just to hold one more time,  
'Cause right now I'm half alive  
Just to look in your eyes.  
There's no living without you,  
No matter what I do  
Can't you see baby?  
I wanna get back with you.  
Just give me one more try.  
I wanna get back with you.  
Hold me just like before.  
Just stop this hurt inside.  
I gotta get back with you.  
Taking me somewhere warm.  
I wanna get back with you, baby.  
I wanna get back with you, babe.  
I gotta get back with you!  
I wanna get back!  
Oh, take me back  
  

"
143,Tom Jones,If I Only Knew,"Ow!!  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Home grown, on the bone  
All the channels show the same old war zone  
As I walk alone in the city  
Makin' me an offer, now don't they look pretty  
New cinema  
Live action, all the noise of attraction beats up  
On the streets, the sellers do mark up  
Better than tellin' 'em off, don't stock up  
Shark, they don't bite  
All that matters is you're not here tonight  
And now that I wonder  
Am I gonna dig a hole ten feet under  
Under sea, under you, under we, undivided,  
Undecided  
  
[Chorus]  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
Up north where the snow grows colder  
I travel onward 'cross the border  
  
Looked up a girl that I once knew frozen  
To be the follower of the deity  
Make myself scarce while they  
come to plea bargain  
for my body and soul  
All the flames go around, surround me  
I won't go  
  
I need the ozone  
I want to cuddle up behind your backbone  
I never stay long where I'm not wanted  
I fell haunted  
Yo brother  
Where ya gonna go  
Back to the war zone  
To break down the walls  
  
Chorus:  
  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you happy  
to make you make you happy  
  
If only I knew what i should do, yeah  
To make you make you love me  
I bared my soul to the golden traces  
went to the forest of the holy places  
And now I wonder  
Am I gonna dig a hole ten feet under  
Under sea, under me, under you, under we, undivided,  
Undecided  
Yeah ... yeah  
(vocal breakdown)  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you happy  
to make you make you happy  
If I only knew  
What I should do  
To make you make you happy  
to make you make you happy  
If I only knew  
What I could do  
To make you, make you love me  
to make you make you love me  
If I only knew  
What I should do  
To make you make you love me  
If I only knew what I should do  
If I only knew what I should do

148,Tom Jones,I'm Counting On You,"The night is so wild  
And downstairs the child is sleeping, her spirit is free  
For more than an hour I have walked in the rain  
I've been wondering what she will be  
But where are the heroes, where are the dreams that I had  
When I was young?  
Am I hoping in vain, just to think she could change anything?  
Well, I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you  
To bring that sweet gentleness to your world and all that you do  
My generation is losing its way, we don't know what we're leaving for you  
So may there be millions who feel like you do, oh my love  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone  
When this is your world and I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you  
Come to me, turn to me, give me your eyes  
When you see the mysteries of time  
Here there are those who just live in the past  
They will never let history lie  
And this sad little island is breaking my heart with its dark  
Shades of green  
And as hard as I try I just cannot see why this should be  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone  
When this is your world and I'm counting on you  
So may there be millions who feel like you do, oh my love  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone  
When this is your world  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone

That she was not the one for me?  
  
You told me all along,  
You're right, our love was so wrong.  
But now I changed my mind,  
Because she broke the ties that bind,  
And I know that she never cared for me.  
  
Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do,  
I guess I'm not so smart.  
Oh, you tried to tell me along she'd only break my heart.

Than one or two I remember there's a radio Comin' from the room next door And
my mother laughed The way some ladies do When it's late in the evening And the
music's seeping through The next thing I remember I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right I'm with my boys I'm with my troops, yeah And down along
the avenue Some guys were shooting pool And I heard the sound Of a cappella
groups, yeah Singing late in the evening And all the girls out on the stoops,
yeah Then I learned to play some lead guitar I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J"" And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening And I blew that room away The first thing I
remember When you came into my life I said I'm gonna get that girl No matter
what I do Well I guess I'd been in love before And once or twice I been on the
floor But I never loved no one The way that I loved you And it was late in the
evening And all the music seeping through

156,Tom Jones,Little Green Apples,"And I wake up in the mornin'  
With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi""  
And I stumble to the breakfast table  
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye  
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand  
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?""  
And I look across at smilin' lips  
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun  
  
And if that's not lovin' me  
Then all I've got to say  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss  
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime  
And when my self is feelin' low  
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind  
  
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy  
And ask her if she could get away and meet me  
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat  
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me  
And I'm always late  
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me  
'cause she's made that way  
  
And if that ain't lovin' me  
Then all I've got to say  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes  
And there's no such thing as make-believe  
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns  
  
God didn't make little green apples  
And it don't rain in Indianapolis

A little bag of tricks  
My mama told me to watch myself but I didn't listen  
Because for you baby I'd scratch out my eye  
Looking out my window  
Down the railroad track  
Waiting for that little brown eyed girl  
She's coming back

Down the line  
Come back girl

WITH JOOLS HOLLAND  
WRITERS DOC POMUS, MORT SHUMAN  
I just got your letter baby Too bad you can't come home I swear I'm goin'

Monday Since you've been away Since your gone I got a mess of blues Whoops
there goes a teardrop Rollin' down my face If you cry when you're in love It
sure ain't no disgrace Whoops there goes a teardrop Rollin' down my face If
you cry when you're in love It sure ain't no disgrace I gotta get myself
together Before I lose my mind I'm gonna catch the next train goin' And leave
my blues behind Since your gone I got a mess of blues I got a mess of blues

161,Tom Jones,Middle Age Crazy,"Today he traded his '98 Oldsmobile  
He got a heck of a deal on a new Porsche car  
He isn't wearing his usual gray business suits  
He's got jeans and high boots with an embroidered star  
'Cause today he's forty years old, going on twenty  
But don't look for the gray in his hair  
'Cause he ain't got any  
He's got a young thing beside him  
That just melts in his hands  
And he's middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can  
He's got a woman he's loved for a long, long time at home  
But the thrill is all gone, when they turn down the lights  
And today he's forty years old, going on twenty  
And don't look for the gray in his hair  
'Cause he ain't got any  
And that young thing beside him, you know she understands  
He's just middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can  
Yes, he's middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can

162,Tom Jones,Motherless Child,"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child  
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child  
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child  
  
A long long way from home  
A long long way from home  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone  
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone  
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone  
  
And I know my time's not long  
I know that my time, it's not long  
Sometimes I feel like I'm heaven bound  
Sometimes I feel like I'm heaven bound  
Sometimes I feel like I'm heaven bound  
  
And I wear a golden crown  
I wear a golden crown  
Sometimes I feel like my soul is on fire  
Sometimes I feel like my soul is on fire  
Sometimes I feel like my soul is on fire  
  
And I'm about to die  
And I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
I'm about to die  
  
I ain't got nobody to love me  
I ain't got nobody to hold me  
I ain't got nobody to squeeze me  
I'm just a motherless child  
I'm just a motherless child

"
165,Tom Jones,My Elusive Dreams,"You followed me to Texas, you followed me to Utah  
We didn't find it there so we moved on  
Then you went with me to A-la-bam'  
Things looked good in Birmingham  
We didn't find it there so we moved on  
I know you're tired of fol-low-ing  
My elusive dreams and schemes  
For they're only fleeting things  
My elusive dreams  
  
You had my child in Memphis then I heard of work in Nashville  
But we didn't find it there so we moved on  
To a small farm in Nebraska, to a gold mine in Alaska  
We didn't find it there so we moved on  
I know you're tired of fol-low-in'  
My elusive dreams and schemes  
For they're only fleeting things  
My elusive dreams  
  
Now we've left A-las-ka because there was no gold mine  
But this time only two of us moved on  
And now all we have is each other and a little memory  
To cling to and still you won't let me go on alone  
I know you're tired of following  
My elusive dreams and schemes  
For they're only fleeting things  
My elusive dreams

"
166,Tom Jones,My Foolish Heart,"How white the ever constant moon  
Take care, my foolish heart  
  
There's a line between love and fascination  
That's hard to see on an evening such as this  
For they give the very same sensation  
When you are lost in the passion of a kiss  
  
Your lips are much too close to mine  
Beware, my foolish heart  
But should our eager lips combine  
Then let the fire start  
For this time it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, it's love

"
167,Tom Jones,Never,"From the first time that I heard you I knew  
I'd be hooked on you forever like the blues  
People told me you would hurt me, so untrue  
Cos after all these years, you're the one thing thats still here  
Cos of you there's no alone  
You've been with me through it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Never, never, never, never gonna give you up  
Running through my blood  
Never Never Never Never leaving you behind  
Always on my mind  
Can't get enough of your highs and your lows  
You take me places where nobody goes  
And if you went away, I would never be the same  
  
Oh your sweetness is like sugar on my lips  
When you're not around its your melody that I miss  
Like an old friend you come back to me so quick  
And after all this time I've still got you in my life  
You and me we're going strong  
You and me we still belong  
  
[Chorus: x3]

169,Tom Jones,Release Me,"Oh please release me, let me go  
For I just don't love you anymore  
To waste our lives would be a sin

And I will always want her near  
Her lips are warm while yours are cold  
Oh release me, my darling let me go  
  
Please release me, let me go  
For I just don't love you anymore  
To waste our lives would be a sin

170,Tom Jones,Resurrection Shuffle,"Who who  
Twist yourself further from the middle of the floor  
Throw a little kiss to the woman next door  
Step on the gas put your hand in the air  
Make a V-sign and you throw back your hair  
Think about nothin' now you're nice and high  
You're advocating love but you don't know why  
Now you're getting vibrations all down to your feet  
That's the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection beat  
  
Put your hand on your hips  
Now you let your backbone slip  
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air  
Make a V sign you just don't care  
Now you feel free you gotta lose control  
All Gods children got a little bit of soul  
You don't have to think you don't have to move a muscle  
To do the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection shuffle

Here we go  
Put your hand on your hip  
You gotta let your backbone slip  
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air  
Make a V sign like you just don't care  
Now you feel free you gotta lose control  
  
All Gods children got some soul  
You don't have to think you don't have to move a muscle  
To do the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection shuffle

"
171,Tom Jones,Running Bear,"On the banks of the river  
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave  
On the other side of the river  
Stood his lovely Indian maid  
Little White Dove was her name  
Such a lovely sight to see  
But their tribes fought with each other  
So their love could never be  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die  
He couldn't swim the raging river  
'Cause the river, it was too wide  
He couldn't reach little White Dove  
Waiting there on the other side  
In the moonlight, he could see her  
Throwing kisses 'cross the wave  
Her little heart was beating faster  
Waiting there for her brave  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die  
Running Bear dove in the water  
Little White Dove, she did the same  
As they swam out to each other  
Through the swirling stream they came  
Now their hands touched and their lips met  
The swirling river, it pulled them down  
Now they'll always be together  
In their happy hunting ground  
Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Yes, Running Bear loved little White Dove  
With a love that couldn't die  

"
172,Tom Jones,Satisfaction,"I can't get no satisfaction  
I can't get no satisfaction  
'Cause I try and I try  
Yes, I try, I try  
I can't get no satisfaction  
I can't get no satisfaction  
When I'm cruisin' in my car  
And the man comes on the radio  
He's tellin' me more and more  
About some useless information  
Supposed to fire my imagination  
And I can 't get no satisfaction  
Oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey  
Ooh, baby, tell me what I say  
Oh, well, when I'm watching my TV  
And this man comes on and tells me  
What drink would be good for me  
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke  
The same cigars as me  
And I can't get no satisfaction  
No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey  
Tell me what I say  
When I'm ridin' 'round the world  
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that  
And I'm tryin' to meet some girl  
Who tells me, baby, baby, come back, maybe next week  
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak  
I can't get no satisfaction  
Oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey  
Baby, tell me what I say  
Come here, baby  
What do ya mean  
You don't know what will satisfy me  
Yes, you do  
I've been all around the world  
Looking for some girl  
And I can't get no satisfaction  
And I've got to have some satisfaction  

"
173,Tom Jones,Say You'll Stay Until Tomorrow,"[Chorus]  
Say you'll stay until tomorrow  
I can't face tonight alone  
Though I know it's over and we're through  
Say you'll stay until tomorrow  
  
I need you  
The words have all been said  
Your mind's made up to go  
You're standing by the bed  
Like someone I don't know  
  
Your love has died and there is nothing you can do  
Though you try (though you try)  
Yes, you try (yes, you try)  
You can't live (you can't live)  
With a lie, so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've known for some time now  
That thing's just ain't been right  
'Cause when we try to talk  
We both get so uptight  
  
But now you've told the truth  
And I know where I stand  
Though it hurts (though it hurts)  
Deep inside (deep inside)  
Give me time (give me time)  
I'll get by, so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though I know it's over and we're through  
Say you'll stay until tomorrow  
I need you

"
174,Tom Jones,Spanish Harlem,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun  
It only comes out when the moon is on the run  
And all the stars are gleaming  
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete  
But soft and sweet and dreaming  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul  
And starts a fire there and then I lose control  
I have to beg your pardon  
  
I'm going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
I'm going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)

175,Tom Jones,Strange Boat,"We're sailing on a strange boat  
Heading for a strange shore  
We're sailing on a strange boat  
Heading for a strange shore  
  
Carrying the strangest cargo  
That was ever hauled aboard  
We're sailing on a strange sea  
Blown by a strange wind  
  
We're sailing on a strange sea  
Blown by a strange wind  
Carrying the strangest crew, crew  
That ever sinned  
  
We're riding in a strange car  
We're followin' a strange star  
We're climbing on the strangest ladder  
That was ever there to climb

"
176,Tom Jones,The Bed,"I wake from trouble sleep  
In the middle of the night  
Reaching for the soft hand  
That once held mine so tight  
My fingers touch the pillow  
Where you once laid your head  
And I run my hand down  
The cold cold sheets  
On your side of the bed  
My head spins from  
The perfume  
That lingers every place  
And I kiss the trace  
Of lipstick  
Left on your pillow case  
And here in this nightmare  
Of darkness  
I remember the day we wed  
And I clutch and tear  
At the tear stained sheets  
On my side of the bed  
My arms long to hold you  
My lips hunger for your kiss  
And I just couldn't  
Stand to go through  
Another lonely night like this  
These hands that once  
Coressed you  
Take a bottle from the drawer  
It says take one for sleeping  
But I'm taking many more  
What good is there  
In living if the dreams  
We shed are dead  
So now at last  
I lay me down to sleep  
On you side of the bed  

"
177,Tom Jones,The Rose,"My love said to me  
""A hero you'll be  
If you bring me the rose of love""  
So, today I must go where the wide rivers flow  
Down from the hills above  
From beginning to end  
Who will guide me, my friend  
For the difficult task that she chose?  
Will the sun and the rain  
From whose bosom I came  
Show me the way to The Rose?  
For my true love I yearn  
But I'll never, ever return  
Till I find where that red lady grows  
When I find her, I'll sing  
And the mission bells will ring  
The news that I've captured The Rose

178,Tom Jones,The Things That Matter Most To Me,"THE THINGS THAT MATTER MOST TO ME  
WRITERS DON PITTMAN, BILL TAYLOR, THOMAS LAVERNE  
Yes there are many precious mem'ries that I'd like to recall  
And there are some things that I would surely like to forget  
I've been up Lord I've been down and sometimes just in between  
But you know something neighbors I haven't reached to my highest mountain yet  
Yes I know Gods bless me time and time and time and time again  
And these blessings for exceeding my deepest woe  
I've had the help of loved ones and many friends who stood by me  
And without their favor I would have given up a long long time ago  
I remember my boyhood days back in Faraday Louisiana  
The long hot summer and that cool Louisiana rain  
You know sometimes I wish I could go back and relive yesterday  
Oh Lord and for a while be mama's little boy again  
You know folks the things that matter most in this old world money just can't
buy  
Sweet love precious mem'ries that will live on and on and on  
And I remember Lord when I stumble sometimes fall I wonder why  
Then I'll then I'll never never never walk alone  
Yes these are the things that matter most to me  
Precious mem'ries from your friend Jerry Lee  
  

"
179,Tom Jones,This And That,"I tried to do a little bit of big time moving  
I played the clubs and stayed out late at night  
I tried to lose the memory of a lover  
When someone said, 'Two wrongs don't make a right'  
Well, I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I said I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I tried so hard to really get to understand you  
You took advantage of me from the start, oh baby  
But now it seems that you have found another  
And just like me you're gonna end with a broken heart  
Oh no, listen to me  
'cause I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I said I had too much baby, of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
Call me if you're all alone and blue  
Say you love me and I'll come running to you  
And I will, you know I will do anything for you, oh  
'cause I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
Listen baby, I had too much honey, of this and that  
And this and that is no good, no good  
One time  
I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good, no good, no good  
I said I had too much baby, of this and that

180,Tom Jones,Weeping Annaleah,"Yesterday the sun was shining, but you're finding  
The sun don't shine all the time  
A winter day suddenly came your way  
And you ran into your mind  
  
Sleeping Annaleah, weeping Annaleah  
You think you're ready for me?  
  
Oh, and yesterday is gone forever and ever  
Never to be again  
You looked for the sunshine that brought  
Warmth to your mind, but find only rain  
  
Sleeping Annaleah, weeping Annaleah  
No, you're not ready for me  
  
But when yesterday becomes a memory  
A memory that we uncovered in time  
If you still remember that cold December  
I reigned in your mind  
  
Sleeping Annaleah, weeping Annaleah  
Then you'd be ready for me  
  
Sleeping Annaleah, weeping Annaleah

183,Tom Jones,Who's Gonna Take You Home Tonight,"There's a place you go after dark  
Where you sell your haunted heart  
In the shadows you look for the friend  
Who'll take you where the sidewalks ends  
And it's a sad affair  
You reach out but no one's there  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Take your hand and hold you tight  
Who'll be the one to make it right  
And promise you paradise  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Turn the darkness into light  
And wipe away the tears you cry  
Just another stranger  
Will be taking you home tonight  
You couldn't see that love was the price  
What happened to the light in your eyes  
Broken dreams fall at your feet  
You stand alone on a dead end street  
So who's gonna hear you prayer  
Look around there's no one there  
He'll tell you dreams come true  
And take you to some rented room  
But when the blinds are drawn  
Another angel will fall  
I guess it's in your blood  
One love just ain't enough  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Take your hand and hold you tight  
Who'll be the one to make it right  
And promise you paradise  
Tell me who's gonna take you home tonight  
Turn the darkness into light  
And wipe away the tears you cry  
Just another stranger  
Will be taking you home tonight

185,The Beatles,A Day In The Life,"I read the news today, oh boy  
About a lucky man who made the grade  
And though the news was rather sad  
Well I just had to laugh  
I saw the photograph.  
  
He blew his mind out in a car  
He didn't notice that the red lights had changed  
A crowd of people stood and stared  
They'd seen his face before  
Nobody was really sure  
If he was from the House of Lords.  
  
I saw a film today, oh boy  
The English army had just won the war  
A crowd of people turned away  
But I just had to look  
Having read the book  
I'd love to turn you on.  
  
Woke up, fell out of bed,  
Dragged a comb across my head  
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,  
And looking up I noticed I was late.  
  
Found my coat and grabbed my hat  
Made the bus in seconds flat  
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.  
  
I read the news today oh boy  
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire  
And though the holes were rather small  
They had to count them all  
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.  
I'd love to turn you on.

229,The Beatles,Fixing A Hole,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in  
And stops my mind from wandering  
Where it will go  
  
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door  
And kept my mind from wandering  
Where it will go  
  
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right  
Where I belong I'm right  
Where I belong.  
  
See the people standing there who disagree and never win  
And wonder why they don't get in my door  
I'm painting my room in the colourful way  
  
And when my mind is wandering  
There I will go  
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right  
Where I belong I'm right  
Where I belong.  
  
Silly people run around they worry me  
And never ask me why they don't get past my door  
I'm taking the time for a number of things  
That weren't important yesterday  
And I still go  
  
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in  
And stops my mind from wandering  
Where it will go

And now the thought of meeting you  
Makes me weak in the knee.

Sail across the Atlantic  
To be where you belong.  
  
Will the wind that blew her boat  
Across the sea  
Kindly send her sailing back to me.

If I could see you now  
I'd try to make you sad somehow  
But I can't, so I'll cry instead  
  
Don't want to cry when there's people there  
I get shy when they start to stare  
I'm gonna hide myself away  
But I'll come back again someday  
  
And when you do you'd better hide all the girls  
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world  
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two  
And show you what your lovin' man can do  
Until then I'll cry instead

And so it's true pride comes before a fall

I'm a loser  
And I lost someone who's near to me  
I'm a loser  
And I'm not what I appear to be

290,The Beatles,Jingle Bells,"Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh  
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way  
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!  
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh  
  
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side  
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot  
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A day or two ago, the story I must tell  
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell  
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh  
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young  
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song  
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed  
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead

291,The Beatles,Johnny B. Goode,"Deep down in Louisianna  
Close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods  
Among the evergreens  
There stand a country cabin  
Made of clay and wood  
Where lives a young country boy  
Named Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned  
To read or write a book so well  
But he could play his guitar  
Just like a-ringing a bell  
  
Go go, go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Aah Johnny B. Goode!  
  
He used to carry his guitar  
In a gunny sack  
Sit beneath the trees  
By the railroad track  
Oh sitting and a-playing  
In the shade  
Drumming to the rhythm  
That the drivers made  
People passing by  
Used to stop and say  
My oh my  
That country boy can play  
  
Go go, go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Aah Johnny B. Goode!  
  
Well his mama told him  
Someday you will be a man  
And you will be the leader  
Of a big old band  
Many people coming  
From miles around  
To hear you play your music  
Till the sun goes down  
Maybe some day  
Your name will be in light  
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!  
  
Go go, go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Go Johnny go go go!  
Aah Johnny B.Goode!

In the sun

So I sing a song of love, Julia.  
  
When I cannot sing my heart  
I can only speak my mind, Julia.

So I sing a song of love, Julia.  
  
Hum hum hum hum, calls me  
So I sing a song of love, Julia, Julia, Julia.

Love you more than any other guy  
And I'll forgive the lies that I  
Heard before, when you gave me no reply  
  
I tried to telephone  
They said you were not home  
That's a lie  
'Cause I know where you've been  
And I saw you walk in  
Your door  
I nearly died  
I nearly died  
'Cause you walked hand in hand  
With another man  
In my place  
No reply

321,The Beatles,Norwegian Wood,"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...  
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?  
  
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,  
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.  
  
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine  
We talked until two and then she said, ""It's time for bed""  
  
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.  
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath  
  
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown  
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?

An octopus' garden with me

We would be warm below the storm  
In our little hideaway beneath the waves  
Resting our head on the sea bed  
In an octopus' garden near a cave  
  
We would sing and dance around  
Because we know we can't be found  
I'd like to be under the sea  
In an octopus' garden in the shade  
  
We would shout and swim about  
The coral that lies beneath the waves  
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)  
Oh what joy for every girl and boy  
Knowing they're happy and they're safe  
(Happy and they're safe)  
  
We would be so happy you and me  
No one there to tell us what to do

I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.  
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you.  
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you.  
  
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down  
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.  
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you.  
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you.

I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject.  
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together  
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

330,Dusty Springfield,24 Hours From Tulsa,"Dearest darlin', I had to write to say  
That I won't be home anymore  
For somethin' happened to me as I was driving home  
And I'm not the same anymore  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
And I saw a welcoming light  
And stopped to rest for the night  
  
And that is when I saw him as I pulled in outside  
Of the small motel he was there  
And so I walked up to him, asked where I could get something  
To eat and he showed me where  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
He took me to a cafe  
And he asked me if I would stay, I said okay  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
The jukebox started to play  
And nighttime turned into day  
  
As we were dancing closely all of a sudden  
I lost control, as he held me tight  
And then he kissed me, caressed me  
Told me, he'd die before he would let me out of his arms  
  
Oh, I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh, only one day away from your arms  
I hate to do this to you  
But I found somebody new, what can I do  
  
And I can never, never, never go home again

331,Dusty Springfield,A Song For You,"I've been so many places  
In my life and time

I made some bad rhymes  
  
I've acted out my life in stages  
Ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
I know your image of me  
Is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly  
But, darling, can't you see  
There's no one more important to me?  
Oh, baby, can't you, please, see through me?  
'Cause we're alone now, and  
I'm singing this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets  
Of the truth, withholding nothing  
You came out in front, I was hiding  
Oh, but now I'm so much better  
If the words don't come together  
Just listen to the melody  
'Cause my love's in there hiding  
Oh, oh  
  
Oh, I love you in a place  
Where there's no space or time  
Love you for my life  
You are a friend of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and  
I was singing this song for you  
We were alone  
I was singing this song for you, oh  
Singing  
I was singing, singing, singing, singing, singing this song for you  
Oh, yes

Took on a change-a?

Cloud of loneliness I feel like I'm dead

I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, boy  
You took the life from my world  
Crushed my dreams  
And I don't mean maybe, baby, baby  
And it ain't no sun since you've been gone

Was as bright as the sun, yes it was  
I ain't got no future since you've been gone  
  
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, yes you did  
You took the life from my world  
Crushed my dreams  
And I don't mean maybe, baby, baby  
It seems like night in the middle of the day  
Everything around me is faded and grey  
Cold are the days  
Dark creeps the night  
Never bringing you back into my life  
It ain't no sun since you've been gone

I wonder what you're thinking, beautiful woman  
It seems like fog is settling in within your eyes  
And the weight of something is pulling your shoulders down  
  
Could it be you ask too much, lovable lady?  
From a world that's out of touch, beautiful woman  
So you're hammering at a door that will not open  
And your beautiful soul is weeping  
  
Better learn the way it goes  
Oh, better share the pain that shows  
You wanna transcend it in order to end it  
But your loneliness grows  
  
Ah, ha, do you hate yourself, lovable lady?  
Can I be of help, beautiful woman?  
Your silence is a wall between the two of us  
And my beautiful soul is weeping

Out of darkness into light  
You come running pushing time  
Out of reason  
Out of rhyme  
Bits and pieces of your past  
Cling like shadows to your heels  
And your heart is learning fast  
How it feels  
  
With your secrets in your eyes  
And your feelings in disguise  
You come running in your fright  
Seeking shelter from the night  
And you search each passing face  
For a sign someone could care  
But they rush by in their race  
To nowhere  
  
And you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone your arms can hold  
Who will let you tell what begs to be told  
Then you ask yourself what good are your dreams?  
In a world where nothing is what it seems  
  
Bits and pieces of your past  
Chill your soul like winter rain  
But the time will come at last  
When a love will ease your pain  
If you let me I will try  
If you let me I'll be near  
If you let me when you cry  
I will hear  
  
Oh, oh and you watch and wonder where you belong  
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along  
And the colors splash and repaint your sky  
And reality is yours to deny  
And you look for someone your arms can hold  
Who will let you tell what begs to be told

349,Dusty Springfield,Broken Blossoms,"I walk where once the grass was green  
And mourn the lark that sings no more  
What bird could sing whose eyes have seen  
Broken blossoms on the field of war?  
  
And as they lie there in the sun  
How unimportant now it seems  
Just who has lost and who has won  
When with them have died so many dreams  
  
They dreamed that endless hate would end  
Unceasing fear, one day, would cease  
They dreamed that foe would turn to friend  
And eternal war would turn to peace  
  
But who can say how many more  
Will join these young and hopeful men?  
In fields they've never seen before  
Far from fields they'll never see again

'Cause they don't last  
So all that I ask  
Go easy on me  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Easy, ooh, ooh, ooh

"
375,Dusty Springfield,Goin' Back,"I think I'm goin' back  
To the things I learned so well in my youth,  
I think I'm returning to  
The days when I was young enough to know the truth  
  
Now there are no games  
To only pass the time  
No more coloring books,  
No Christmas bells to chime  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can play the game of life to win  
  
I can recall a time,  
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend  
And now I think I've got  
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift  
  
Now there's more to do  
Than watch my sailboat glide  
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride  
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,  
And live my life instead of counting my years  
  
Let everyone debate the true reality,  
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be  
A little bit of freedom, all we're left  
So catch me if you can  
I'm goin' back  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember  
  
I can recall,  
I can remember

376,Dusty Springfield,Gotta Get Used To You,"Who d'you think you're kidding?  
You walk out on my life  
Now, you're back again  
And you think that nothing's changed  
Denying superstitions, defying traditions  
It seems like we've been through this before  
Now, it's gonna be like starting all over again  
Oh, baby, don't you know?  
It's gonna be like starting all over again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you  
I got to get used to you, again  
You know I love to feel you  
Reach the depth of my heart  
Deep inside of me  
The way it used to do  
I've had so many lovers  
No-one could ever tame me  
They all seem to rub me the wrong way  
They always get my back up  
No-one seems to do the things that you do for me  
And now that you're back in my life again  
I gotta get used to you  
I gotta get used to you, again  
I gotta get used to you

377,Dusty Springfield,Guess Who,"(Guess who?)  
Where's the girl who hurt herself last night?  
(Guess who?)  
Didn't kiss you and thought she was right  
Everyone had told me  
Be careful when he holds me  
And I was  
  
(Guess who?)  
Had to listen to all that she hears  
(Guess who?)  
Has a pillow that's all wet with tears  
You were oh-so tender  
But I wouldn't surrender  
Now you're gone  
  
I told my friends ""He'll never get my heart""  
And when I kissed you  
Had to resist you  
Said ""Better go""  
I hurt you so  
  
Wished you had stayed  
But I made you go away  
(Guess who?)  
Tried to be much too cool yesterday  
(Guess who?)  
Let the boy that she loves get away  
I never should have listened  
'Cause now your love I'm missin'  
It's too late  
Woah, it's too late, ahh, ha  
  
I never should have listened

In my dreams  
Every hour all night through

Of this trouble that you've got me in  
If I hurt you  
Didn't mean to  
Oh, and I'm sorry

379,Dusty Springfield,Heart And Soul,"Ooh, hoo  
It was back in 'sixty-three  
We were young and we were free  
Thought the world was really ours for the taking  
We had heart and we had soul  
Ooh, we lived for rock and roll  
And didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?  
Fashions come and fashions go  
We were there so we should know  
I sometimes smile when I think of how I looked then  
Burning candles at both ends  
Hoping time would make amends  
And didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do  
Heart and soul will see it through, oh, ho  
Now we're older nothing's changed  
Just some things are rearranged  
But the message is the same as when we started  
We're gettin' stronger everyday  
Looking back now we can say  
Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we do it?, ahh  
With heart and soul  
The world is yours, the stars are too  
If you bring out the best in you  
With heart and soul  
Whatever you've been wantin' to do

380,Dusty Springfield,Hollywood Movie Girls,"Today I went out on a movie call  
I saw a million nervous faces  
I knew them all  
Hollywood movie girls  
We're all wearing our one good interview dress  
The one showin' our legs  
Aah, we're lookin' our best  
Now, who will be chosen for the screen test?  
It's your guess  
Hollywood movie girls  
And each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a one-room flat?  
Well, as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
Each morning up early to call on the 'phone  
Agents, producers, oh, they're never at home  
Like door-to-door salesmen, we are selling ourselves  
Ooh, nothing else  
Hollywood movie girls  
And each and every potential star  
Drives home in the night in her economy car  
Whoever thought home would be a one-room flat?  
Well, as simple as that  
Hollywood movie girls  
And just about bedtime each one of us asks  
Tell me, when will I make it to the big-time at last?  
Oh, small parts you're offered  
Aah, but those too shall pass  
Nothing lasts  
Hollywood movie girls  
Yeah, and each and every potential star

And it isn't the way that you talk  
It isn't the things that you say or do  
Make me want you so  
  
It is nothing to do with the wine  
Or the music that's flooding my mind  
But never before have I been so sure  
You're the someone I dreamed I would find  
  
It's the way you make me feel  
The moment I am close to you  
It's a feeling so unreal  
Somehow I can't believe it's true  
The pounding I feel in my heart  
The hoping that we'll never part  
I can't believe this is really happening to me  
  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here  
I close my eyes and count again  
I can't believe it but you're still here  
  
We were strangers a moment ago  
With a few dreams but nothing to show  
The world was a place  
With a frown on its face  
And tomorrow was just, I don't know  
  
But the way you make me feel  
The moment I am close to you  
Makes today seem so unreal  
Somehow I can't believe it's true  
Tomorrow will you still be here?  
Tomorrow will come but I fear  
That what is happening to me  
Is only a dream  
  
I close my eyes and count to ten  
And when I open them you're still here

390,Dusty Springfield,I Don't Want To Hear It Anymore,"In my neighborhood  
We don't live so good

He sure wasn't thinking of her today, oh no

I don't want to hear it anymore  
(I don't want to hear it)  
I don't want to hear it anymore

'Cause the talk just never ends  
And the heartache soon begins  
The talk is so loud  
And the walls are much too thin  
  
Ain't it sad, said the woman down the hall  
That when a nice girl falls in love  
Ain't it just too bad that she had to fall  
For a boy who doesn't care for her at all?  
(It's so sad)  
  
I don't want to hear it anymore

He reassured me everything was still all right  
As the night grew light  
My blues got bright  
He made me know  
I was the star of the show  
  
He said he was mine all to myself  
And i won't, and he won't, ever need nobody else  
He took me in his arms  
And turned on my love  
Ooh, yes he did, yes he did, yes he did, oh, oh  
I had a talk with my man last night  
  
He said never again lonely would i be  
And that's when he asked to marry me  
I began to cry  
He kissed the tears from my weeping eyes  
Oh, yes he did, yes he did, yes he did, oh, oh  
I had a talk with my man last night

You to the light

Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, it's overflowing

Out into the world and the world is very wide  
But one day, (baby, one day), baby, one day  
  
[Chorus: ]  
I will come to you if it takes everyday left in my life  
I will come to you for there must be someone in my life  
No matter where you are  
I'll find you near or far  
Or I will never love 'til I can love with you  
And I won't really live  
For life without you is like dying  
  
Don't know where you are  
And I don't know if you think of me  
But where you are  
Is the only place I want to be  
Lost in a world of nothing much to do  
That's how I am ever since losing you  
But one day, (baby, one day), oh, baby, one day  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
(I will come to you, ooh, ooh)  
There must be someone in my life

And watch you tear it all apart  
And I would not be tortured, tormented and cheated  
And surely my heart would not be broken in two

I watched you hold her tenderly  
And I could see as you kissed her  
Youd never come back to me, oh

One day I know we'll find again  
The love we had and I  
Will know and feel

The only certainty is nothin's sure  
And most things stay the same  
Or go back where they came  
  
And though my answers still are undefined  
By takin' chances I can start to find some reasons  
Somethin' to believe in  
I can make it through  
I can make it through

We should stay together  
If we can  
But what you've planned  
Means there's a difference between  
  
[Chorus]  
What you're gonna say  
In private  
You still want my love  
We're in this together  
And what you're gonna do  
In public  
Say you were never in love  
That you can remember  
  
So discreet  
I never tried to meet  
Your friends or interfere  
I took a back seat between  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What you gonna say, eh  
When you run back to your wife?  
I guess it's just the story of my life  
What you gonna say?  
  
So take your time  
And tell me  
Where did you learn  
Oh, I may publicize  
That there's a difference between  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what you gonna say  
In private?, oh, oh, oh  
What you gonna say?  
What you gonna do?  
Baby, what you gonna say?

413,Dusty Springfield,In The Land Of Make Believe,"In the land of make believe  
You're mine tonight  
Although you are far away  
In the land of make believe  
I'm holding you tight  
  
The silver moon is shining above  
And there's love in your eyes  
And I'm kissing you  
Like I used to do  
Yesterday in paradise  
  
I've been living in the land of make believe  
Since you've been gone  
I need you so much  
That without your love  
I must deceive myself  
To go on  
  
Your loving hand caresses my face  
We embrace tenderly  
Never will we part  
Deep down in my heart  
You are always here with me  
You are always here with me  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
  
Your loving hand caresses my face  
We embrace tenderly  
Never will we part  
Deep down in my heart  
You are always here with me  
You are always here with me  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe  
In the land of make believe

414,Dusty Springfield,In The Middle Of Nowhere,"Where does our love lie  
In the middle of nowhere  
Will it soon pass me by  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Baby, won't you tell me  
What am I to do  
I'm in the middle of nowhere  
Getting nowhere with you  
  
Mmm, where did my heart land  
In the middle of nowhere  
Where are the dreams I planned  
In the middle of nowhere  
  
Listen to me baby  
Listen to my plea  
I'm in the middle of nowhere  
And it's worrying me  
  
Over and over again  
You tell me you need my love  
If what you say is true  
Why can't we be together  
  
Over and over you tell me  
I'm all that you're thinking of  
Baby you know that I love you  
But I can't wait forever

415,Dusty Springfield,In The Winter,"The days are okay  
I watch the T.V. in the afternoon  
If I get lonely  
The sound of other voices  
Other rooms are near to me  
I'm not afraid  
  
The operator  
She tells the time  
It's good for a laugh  
And there's always radio  
And for a dime I can talk to God  
Dial-a-prayer  
Are you there?  
Do you care?  
Are you there?  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
I am wiser now you know  
And still as big a fool concerning you  
  
I met your friend  
She's very nice, what can I say?  
It was an accident  
I never dreamed we'd meet again this way  
You're looking well  
I'm not afraid, yeah  
  
You have a lovely home  
Just like a picture  
No, I live alone  
I found it easier  
You must remember how I never liked the party life  
Up all night  
Lovely wife  
You have a lovely wife  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
You are with her now I know  
I'll live alone forever, not together, now  
  
And in the Winter extra blankets for the cold  
Fix the heater, getting old  
You are with her now I know  
I'll live alone forever, not together,

416,Dusty Springfield,Island Of Dreams,"I wander the streets  
And the gay crowded places  
Trying to forget you  
But somehow it seems  
That my thoughts ever stray  
To our last sweet embraces  
Over the sea on the island of dreams  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
High in the sky is a bird on a wing  
Please carry me with you  
Far, far away from the mad rushing crowd  
Please carry me with you  
Again I would wander  
Where memories enfold me  
There on the beautiful island of dreams  
  
Far, far away on the island of dreams

417,Dusty Springfield,It's Over,"If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This love we shared  
Would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
No morning light above  
To make me realize our love  
Is over  
  
And now you walk away from me  
And there's no place to put my hand  
Except to shade my eyes  
Against the sun that comes to warm the land  
I watch you walk away somehow  
I have to let you go now  
It's over  
  
It's too late to tell you how I feel  
Our love was real  
And yet, there are so many times  
That people have to love and then forget  
Though there might have been a way  
I have to force myself to say  
It's over  
  
And so I walk away and turn my collar to the wind  
I walk along in silence trying not to think at all  
I put my feet before me  
Walk the silent street before me  
It's over  
  
If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This love we shared would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
No morning light above  
To make me realize our love  
Is over  
  
It's over  
It's over  
It's over

418,Dusty Springfield,I've Been Wrong Before,"The night we met  
The night that I won't forget  
You seemed what I'd been waiting for  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
You held me tight  
And everything seemed just right  
I couldn't ask for me  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
He used to smile at me  
And a-hold my hand like you do  
Then he left me  
And a-broke my heart in two  
  
I see your face  
And feel your warm embrace  
You're all that I adore  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
Oh baby, I've been wrong before

Early in the mornin'  
Beats a cup of coffee  
For starting off the day  
  
Just a little lovin'  
When the world is yawnin'  
Makes you feel wake up feeling  
Good things are coming your way  
  
This old world  
Wouldn't be half as bad  
It wouldn't be half as sad

That you'll love me again?  
All I had has been taken from me  
Now I cry tears that never become me

Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
  
How I wish I could say  
All the things I want to say  
If some way, you could see what's in my heart  
Oh, baby

A look, a smile, a touch  
Try to forget

It's so hard to forget  
When your whole world you know is dying  
  
Just one smile means forgiving  
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon

423,Dusty Springfield,Learn To Say Goodbye,"When I close my eyes I can see your face  
Tho' I try I can't believe that you are gone  
There's a part of you that's a part of me  
And no matter where I go it comes along  
Reminding me of all the good times  
And, of course, some of the bad  
But then again, some of those hard times  
Were the best we ever had  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew?  
Learn to say goodbye to you?  
How can I learn to say goodbye?  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you?  
  
When I needed you, you were always there  
You were more than love to me, you were a friend  
They say that time is all that matters  
And to live it while it lasts  
But I can't stop from reminiscing  
Or stop living in the past  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew?  
Learn to say goodbye to you?  
How can I learn to say goodbye?  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you?  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew?  
Say goodbye to you?

Say goodbye to you?

Into the sunshine  
But the sun, oh, coming up  
Doesn't always bring the light, oh  
And somehow, somehow I feel, oh  
It's just not right  
No, not for me  
  
Well it's been so long  
Since I've been loved by name, oh-ho  
Love me by name, ah

433,Dusty Springfield,Love Power,"When we walk  
Down the street  
We don't care  
Who we see  
Or who we meet  
  
Don't have to run  
Don't have to hide  
'Cause we got something burning inside  
  
We got love power  
It's the greatest power of them all  
We got love power  
And together we can't fall  
  
Sometimes we're up  
Sometimes we're down  
But our feet are always on the ground  
We always laugh  
Don't have to cry

434,Dusty Springfield,Lovin' Proof,"I know some lovers would be satisfied  
With sweet, 'I love yous' and some pretty lines  
But that won't get you in this heart of mine  
No, you'll never steal my heart away

And if you love me like you say, you do  
Your tender touch will tell the honest truth  
And your kiss could never tell a lie  
'Cause I'd see it in your eyes  
There is one way to ease any doubt, I tell you now  
If you want me to believe that I'm the only one you need

435,Dusty Springfield,Magic Garden,"There is a garden  
Something like the shadow of a butterfly  
And lies beyond the gates of dark and light  
And darling, it belongs to me  
  
And when you go there  
There will be such laughter in the dimpled sky  
The songs you sing  
Will drive away the night  
The magic garden  
Has a way of making you feel free  
  
It's the place I've made for you  
From match-boxes and cards and dominoes  
And it won't fall down  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside  
  
And when your dreaming vanishes  
Like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside  
  
It's so soft and warm  
Behind those hedges  
No hard edges  
No hard edges  
  
There is a garden  
Vanishes like snowflakes in the summer sky  
Melts away in darkness  
And you don't know why the magic garden  
Waits without the gates wide open  
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside

Surely you see that my lover is sleeping  
Morning please don't come  
Let the night linger on  
When the stars have left the sky  
We must say fond goodbye  
Make the night a little longer  
Morning please don't come  
Starshine glow a little stronger  
Morning please don't come  
Day don't break for you will take  
My love away from me

Sing me a song of a night never-ending  
Sing sweet nightingale  
And I'll try to pretend  
That tomorrow's nowhere near  
And there's nothing to fear  
Make the night a little longer

439,Dusty Springfield,My Colouring Book,"For those who fancy coloring books  
And lots of people do  
Here's a new one for you  
A most unusual coloring book  
The kind you'll never see  
Crayons ready?  
Very well  
Begin to color me  
  
These are the eyes that watched him as he walked away  
Color them grey  
This is the heart that thought he would always be true  
Color it blue  
  
These are the arms that held him and touched him  
Lost him somehow  
Color them empty now  
These are the beads I wore  
Until she came between  
Color them green  
  
This is the room that I sleep in and walk in  
And weep in and hide in  
That nobody, nobody's seen  
Oh, color it lonely, please  
  
This is the man whose love I depended upon  
Color him gone

440,Dusty Springfield,My Lagan Love,"(Irish folk song sang by Dusty on her TV show in 1967)  
  
Where Lagan stream sings lullaby  
There grows a young man fair  
The twilight gleam is in his eye  
The night is on his hair  
And like a lovesick lenan he  
He hath my heart in thrall  
No life I owe, no liberty  
His love is lord of all  
  
And often when the beetles' horn  
Hath lulled the eve to sleep  
I steal unto his shieling lorn  
And thro' the dooring peep  
There on the cricket's singing stone  
He spears the bird in fire  
And hums in sad, sweet undertone  
The song of his desire

Just a memory

447,Dusty Springfield,Nothing Has Been Proved,"Mandy's in the papers 'cause she tried to go to spain  
She'll soon be in the dock and in the papers once again  
Vicki's got her story about the mirror and the cane  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
Stephen's in his dressing-gown now, breakfasting alone  
Too sick to eat, he's on his feet and to the telephone  
The police inspector soothes him with his sympathetic tone  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the house a resignation  
Guilty faces, every one  
Christine's fallen out with lucky  
Johnny's got a gun  
""Please Please Me""'s number one  
  
(It's a scandal! it's a scandal! such a scandal!)  
Now, Stephen's in the dock for spending money that was earned  
By Christine, and the prosecution says that money burned  
A hole in Stephen's pocket, for expensive sins he yearned  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the news the suicide note  
In the court an empty space  
Even Mandy's looking worried  
Christine's pale and drawn  
""Please Please Me""'s number one

Last night he wrote these words to his friend:  
""Sorry about the mess  
I'm guilty 'til proved innocent  
In the public eye and press""  
The funeral's very quiet because all his friends have fled

And summer turns to snow

If you want me for tonight

Knowing you can go

Ohhh  
  
And nothing is forever  
Nothing is forever

449,Dusty Springfield,Nothing Rhymed,"(Gilbert O'Sullivan)  
  
If I give up this seat I've been saving  
To some elderly lady or man  
Am I being a good girl?  
Am I still your sweet pearl?  
Mother please, if you're pleased, say I am  
  
And if, while in the course of my duty,  
I perform an unfortunate take  
Would you punish me so, unbelievably so?  
Never again would I make that mistake  
This feeling inside me  
Can never deny me  
The right to be wrong if I choose  
And the pleasure I get from, say,  
Winning a bet  
Is to lose  
  
When I'm drinking my Bonaparte shandy  
Eating more than enough apple pies  
Would I glance in my screen  
And see real human beings  
Starve to death right in front of my eyes?  
  
Nothing old, nothing new  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained  
Nothing stillborn or lost  
Nothing further than proof  
Nothing older than you  
Nothing sweeter than wine  
Nothing older than time  
Nothing physically, recklessly, hopelessly blind  
Nothing I couldn't say  
Nothing why?  
'Cause today nothing rhymed, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Yeah, this feeling inside me  
Can never deny me  
The right to be wrong if I choose  
The pleasure I get from, say  
Winning a bet  
Is to lose  
  
Nothing good, nothing bad  
Nothing ventured, nothing gained  
Nothing stillborn or lost  
Nothing further than proof  
Nothing wilder than you  
Nothing sweeter than wine  
Nothing older than time  
Nothing physically, hopelessly, recklessly, blind  
Nothing I couldn't say  
Nothing why?  
'Cause today nothing rhymed, ooh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh  
Nothing rhymed

"
450,Dusty Springfield,Of All The Things,"Of all the things I've ever done  
Finding you will prove to be  
The most important one  
I would never trade the tears  
The conversation no-one hears  
The learning how to walk before we run  
  
Of all the kites I ever flew  
Most came tumbling down  
Except the one I sent up with you  
I don't want to change a thing  
Break the spell  
Cut the string  
When every wish I made is coming true  
With you  
  
Sometimes I forget  
To say how much I love you  
Purposely I bet  
'Cause I'm so busy thinking of you  
  
So, in this world of odds and ends  
I'd rather have a part of you  
Than all of my so-called friends  
You have taught me how to feel  
What is false and what is real  
Of all the things I ever want to do  
I think I'll start and end with loving you  
  
Oh, you have taught me how to feel  
What is false and what is real  
Of all the things I ever want to do  
I think I'll start and end with loving you

"
451,Dusty Springfield,Old Habits Die Hard,"It's my decision  
You look my way  
With innocent expression  
Just as if to say  
It would be easy  
The mood is right  
Forget for just one moment  
Who we are tonight  
I start  
To weaken the music's strong  
My conscience speaks, I know it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Temptation makes a fool out of us all  
  
I made my mind up  
It had to end  
So why this indecision?  
When you're close again  
Oh, the thought's appealing  
I can't deny  
With those old memories stealing  
Back across my mind  
I thought by now that the flame had gone  
I realize that I'm still holding on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll just keep holding on  
It's easier said than done  
  
(Old habits die hard)  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday, no  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday, no  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard  
Give it up  
Remember what you said  
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday  
Give it up  
That's the way it starts  
Discover old habits die hard

452,Dusty Springfield,Once Upon A Time,"When you passed my way  
It seemed my lucky day  
The world was oh-so fine  
Once upon a time  
  
We walked for a little while  
You smiled that special smile  
And when we said goodnight  
You held me oh-so tight  
  
Then you found someone new  
And I spent my nights alone  
'Cause now we're through  
There's nothing I can do  
I gotta say forget...  
Forget him, forget him  
'Cause he's no good, no, no  
  
Now, when you pass my way  
I guess I'll smile and say  
To think that boy was mine  
Once upon a time  
  
To think that boy was mine  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
Woh, oh, once upon a time  
No, no, no, no, no, once upon a time

454,Dusty Springfield,Poor Wayfaring Stranger,"I am a poor, wayfaring stranger  
Wandering o'er this world of woe  
And there's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land to which I go  
I'm going home to see my father  
I'm going home, no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home  
I know dark clouds will gather round me  
I know my way is rough and steep  
But beautious fields lie just before me  
Where men redeemed their vigil's keep  
I'm going home to see my mother  
I'm going there, no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home

455,Dusty Springfield,"Quiet Please, There's A Lady On Stage","Quiet please, there's a lady on stage  
She may not be the latest rage  
But she's singing and she means it  
And she deserves a little silence  
  
Quiet please, there's a woman up there  
And she's been honest through her songs  
Long before your consciousness was raised  
Doesn't that deserve a little praise  
  
So put your hands together and help her along  
All that's left of the singer's  
All that's left of the song  
Stand for the ovation  
And give her one last celebration  
  
Quiet please, there's a person up there  
And she's been singing of the things  
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves  
Give her your respect if nothing else  
  
Quiet please, there's a lady on stage  
Conductor, turn the final page  
And when it's over we can all go home  
But she lives on -- on the stage alone.

466,Marianne Faithfull,Barbara Song,"I once used to think in my innocent youth,  
(And I once was as innocent as you),  
That someone some day might come my way,  
And then I should know what's best to do.  
And if he'd got money, and seemed a nice chap,  
And his workday shirts were white as snow,  
And if he knew how to treat a girl with due respect,  
I'd have to tell him, ""No!""  
That's where you must keep your head screwed on and insist on  
Going slow.  
Sure the moon will shine throughout the night,  
Sure the boat is on the river tied up tight,  
That's as far as things can go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
Oh, you must not let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you feel it might start,  
Oh, then your only answer's, ""No!""  
The first one that came was a man of Kent,  
And all that a man ought to be.  
The second one owned three ships down at Wopping,  
And the third was crazy about me.  
And as they'd got money, and all seemed nice chaps,  
And their workday shirts were white as snow,  
And as they knew how to treat a girl with due respect,  
Each time I told them, ""No!""  
That's when I used to get my head screwed on and I chose to take  
It slow.  
Sure the moon could shine throughout the night,  
Sure the boat was on the river tied up tight,  
That's as far as things could go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
Oh, you must not let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you feel it might start,  
Oh, then your only answer's, ""No!""  
But then one day, and the day was blue,  
Came a man who didn't ask at all.  
And he went and hung his hat on the nail of my little attic,  
And what happened, I can't recall.  
And as he'd got no money and was not a nice chap,  
And his Sunday shirts were not like snow,  
And as he'd no idea of treating a girl with due respect,  
I could not tell him, ""No!""  
That's the day my head was not screwed on, and to hell with going  
Slow!  
Oh, the moon could shine so clear and bright,  
Oh, the boat kept drifting downstream that night,  
That was how it simply had to go.  
Oh, you can't lie back, you must stay cold at heart,  
In the end you'll have to let your feelings show.  
Oh, the moment you know it might start,  
And there's no time for saying, ""No!""

No doubt a vicious circle turns and burns.  
Without you, oh I could not live  
Forgive the only person.  
I believe, yes I believe in freedom,  
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.  
Because the night belongs to lovers,

If you'd been there, if you'd been around

Before the poison, I had lost my fear  
Maybe too happy to even care  
Safe in my dream, couldn't see the fog  
Comin' on, coming from nowhere, my name to call  
  
No more to say, nothin's comin' my way  
No you, no me, no more, how can it be?  
Nowhere to run, out of nowhere poison  
They sense the end, what's left for you, my friend?  
  
Before the poison, I'd laugh out loud  
I'd see your face in any crowd  
But speak softly without fear  
Hold on to me, hold me near  
  
No more to say, nothin's comin' my way  
No you, no me, no more, how can it be?  
Nowhere to run, out of nowhere poison

It can hit you  
It can hurt you  
Make you sore  
And what is more,  
That is not what  
You are here for.  
Watch out now, take care,  
Beware of soft shoe shufflers  
Dancing down the sidewalks  
As each unconscious sufferer  
Wanders aimlessly,  
Beware of maya.  
Watch out now, take care,  
Beware of greedy leaders.  
They'll take you where you should not go,  
While weeping atlas cedars,  
They just want to grow, grow and grow.  
Beware of darkness.

470,Marianne Faithfull,Blood In My Eyes,"Woke up this morning, feeling blue  
Seen a good looking girl, can I make love with you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
I went back home, put on my tie  
Gonna get that girl that money will buy  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
She looked at me, begin to smile  
Said, ""Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?""  
No, no babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
No, no babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait  
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
I'll tell you something, tell you the facts  
You don't want to give my money back  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you  
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby

471,Marianne Faithfull,Blowin' In The Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you can call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
How many times can a cannon ball fly  
Before they're forever banned?  
  
[Chorus]  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
  
How many years can a mountain exist  
Before it is washed to the sea?  
How many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
How many times can a man turn his head,  
And pretend that he just doesn't see?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How many times can a man look up  
Before he can see the sky?  
How many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
How many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?  
  
[Chorus]

472,Marianne Faithfull,City Of Quartz,"Charming, someone to fear  
Handsome, very much here  
Evil, dancing through fire  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear  
  
Something to charm  
Danger, someone to harm  
Falling into the mire  
Climbing, higher and higher  
  
Someone to fear  
Handsome, very much here  
Evil, dancing through fire  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear  
  
Ivory tower  
Longing for something now  
Waiting, hour after hour  
Give me some of your power  
  
Citadel, a prison of sorts  
Only the rich make the laws  
Using repression and force  
Whore of Babylon, City of Quartz  
  
Someone to fear  
Hidden and very much here  
Hatred summoned so near  
Whore of Babylon, world famous clear

When love gets old it grows cold  
And then true love will fade away  
And then true love will fade away  
And then true love will fade away  
True love fades away  
True love fades away  
True love fades  
True love fades  
True love fades away.

474,Marianne Faithfull,Come My Way [version 1],"The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door  
Has grown there for two score years or more  
And I've grown weary waiting for love to say  
""Come my way, come my way.""  
  
The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun  
Has danced this mercy dance since time begun  
But o how weary and how long the day will he say  
""Come my way.""  
  
Lovers all around, I wish you joy  
Happiness to every girl and boy.  
But sometimes spare a thought of me and say  
""Love come her way,"" come my way.

476,Marianne Faithfull,Comrade,"Little months little smokes  
And oblivion in a wool dress  
In a door opens tenderly  
Near a wall where the wind is born  
Near the jolly garden  
Where saints and angels  
Are afraid of the seasons  
The alleys have no names  
They are the hours or the years  
I stroll leisurely  
Dressed in a cement overcoat  
And a hat of black straw  
I don't remember  
If it's nice out  
I walk smoking  
And I smoke walking  
Easily  
Every once in a while I tell myself  
It's time to stop  
And I continue walking  
I tell myself  
I have to get some air  
I have to look at the clouds  
And breathe in a lung full  
I have to see the flies fly  
And take a little exercise  
I shouldn't smoke so much  
I tell myself also  
Calculate  
I tell myself again  
I have a headache  
My life is a drop of water on my eyelid  
And I'm no longer twenty  
Continue  
The songs are songs  
And the days days  
I no longer have one shred of respect for myself  
But I see no hoodlums  
Who smoke the same cigarettes as me  
And who are just as stupid as me  
I'm pretty content  
Without really knowing why  
It doesn't suffice to speak of the sun  
The stars  
The sea and rivers  
Blood eyes hands  
It is necessary quite often  
To speak of other things  
We know that there are very beautiful countries  
With very handsome men  
With no less charming women,  
But all that isn't really sufficient  
But dizzying void  
Which rings and bays  
Makes the head bow  
We look and we see  
Again many other things  
Which are always the same  
Innumerable  
Identical  
And over there simply  
Someone goes by  
Simple as hello  
And everything starts all over once again  
I read in the stars the good will of my friends  
In a river I love one hand  
I listen the flowers sing  
There are the goodbyes of birds  
A cry falls like a fruit  
My God my God  
I will be accordingly always the same  
My head in my hands  
And my hands in my head

477,Marianne Faithfull,Conversation On A Barstool,"I'm tired, so tired I can hardly stand,  
I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight.  
It's taken everything I had to give  
And now I just want to get out of here.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for forty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
He came from Miami to start out again.  
To leave him was easy, I did it all the time.  
He said that he loved me and he wanted a child,  
If he opened his mouth, he was telling you lies.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for thirty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
I was an actress, a girl in the Chorus  
On Broadway I danced for a Kennedy.  
They know me in London and they know me in Paris,  
I'm only talkin' 'cause you looked like you needed a friend.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for twenty-five dollars I'm half-way  
To Miami.

480,Marianne Faithfull,Counting,"Now is the glimmering spinning beginning  
Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes  
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows  
Of night, here with you in my arms.  
  
This is the moment that pauses to hold us  
As you and I move in a background of wonder,  
Surrounded by countless enclosures  
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy.  
  
Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower  
And waited, and called out my name by the hour,  
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings  
To carry the sound, I have counted on pleading,  
You see how I need you, come down.  
  
And now between twilight and midnight I come to you,  
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight,  
Bright is the evening, the breezes have fenced us  
And nestled against us  
  
You're here  
And warm.  
  
And mine till the time  
When the dawn will awake you,  
The morning will shake you,  
The highway will take you.  
  
But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets  
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights  
We count on the night to hold everything even,  
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,  
And destinies folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.  
  
But now as the gardens of softening night time  
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,  
You and I come together  
And walk through the dreams of the stars.  
  
So here while the song of the deepening evening  
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,  
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow  
And know where we've been.

481,Marianne Faithfull,Crazy Love,"Hated by all and everywhere he goes  
Blazing contempt for human life and lies  
Murder as art and what he knows he knows  
From life and fear in other people's eyes  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love is crazy love is kind  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
She walks the boulevard without a care  
Knowing too much but having come so far  
Pretending life is just a game you play for nothing  
Loving no one and no where  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love goes crazy given time  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
She looks as if expecting a surprise  
Maybe an encounter that will change her life  
Not knowing hot from cold or good for bad  
If life is just a joke or if it makes her sad  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love is crazy love is kind  
But I know somehow you'll find me  
Love is crazy love is blind  
  
Crazy love is all around me  
Love goes crazy given time

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling.  
It's you, it's you, it's you must go and I must bide.  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,  
Yes, I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.  
  
But when you come, and all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead, as dead I well may be  
You'll come and find rhe place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me.  
  
And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me  
And all my breath shall be warm and sweeter be  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I will sleep in peace until you come for me.

The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go down town  
Things will be great when you're  
Down town  
No finer place for sure  
Down town  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
Don't hang around  
And let your problems surround you  
There are movie shows  
Down town  
  
Maybe you know  
Some little places to go  
To where they never close  
Down town  
  
Just listen to the rhythm of the gentle bossa-nova  
You'll be dancing with them, too, before the night is over  
Happy again  
  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
  
And go down town  
Where all the lights are bright  
Down town  
Waiting for you tonight  
Down town  
You're gonna be all right now  
  
And you may find  
Somebody kind  
To help and understand you  
Someone who is just like you  
And needs a gentle hand  
To guide him along  
  
So maybe I'll see you there  
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares  
  
And go down town  
Things will be great when you're  
Down town  
Don't wait a minute more

Everything's waiting for you

Take it away and pack it in a suitcase.  
Then forget about falling from grace.  
  
Don't look at me like that, I never said a word.  
Don't ask me where I've been, I'll pretend I never heard.  
Don't put it in the paper, please, don't!  
I never said I will, I never said I won't.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's looking bad, I know, I'm an outlaw.  
Don't pity me, I never felt like this before.  
Please tell me you believe me, please say  
I'll get along without you, anyway.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feeling hunted, I'm lying low.  
Don't tell me who it is, I never said so.  
Put yourself in my place, please try.  
I never told the truth, I never told a lie.  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
[Repeats]  
Falling from grace.  
Falling from grace, falling from grace.

492,Marianne Faithfull,Falling In Love Again,"I'm much too sentimental,  
My heart is never free.  
Perhaps it's accidental  
That love should come to me.  
  
Some little thing within me  
Protects me for a while  
Till someone comes to win me  
With only a smile.  
  
Falling in love again,  
Never wanted to.  
What am I to do?  
Can't help it.  
  
Love's always been my game,  
Play it, how I may.  
I was made that way  
Can't help it.  
  
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame  
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame.  
  
Falling in love again,  
Never wanted to.  
What am I to do?  
Can't help it.  
  
Sonst gar nichts.  
Ha!

"
493,Marianne Faithfull,Flaming September,"The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
The sisters dancing  
No happy ending to the game  
Don't bother to call me  
Think I'll stay here just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Flaming September  
What can you give me that is true?  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave to you?  
  
The summer dying  
September lives in flames  
My youth lies bruised and broken  
No happy ending to the game  
Don't bother to tell me  
I'll live on here just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Flaming September  
What can you show me that is true?  
My heart remembers  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
All the life I gave  
To you?  
  
Flaming September  
Flaming September

494,Marianne Faithfull,For Wanting You,"It comes as no surprise  
Your face filled with lies  
Hovers all around me in this room  
Clouds hung with my dismay  
A hot bed where we lay  
Your every kiss tasting like a tomb  
If time becomes a judge  
If my body holds a grudge  
It's just because I needed sanctuary  
Your skin under my nails  
My curiosity that failed  
To save myself for something that I need  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you  
We do things 'cause we must  
The law of love and lust  
Comes together just like oil on flame  
I looked into your eyes  
You saw me naked for a while  
How d'you like it in my little nest?  
Who was really using who?  
In here the scent of you  
Stains the sheets with memory and lust  
When I get back on the street  
Tell everybody that I meet  
Maybe these aren't scars, they're only rust  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you  

"
495,Marianne Faithfull,For What It's Worth,"There's something happening here,  
What it is ain't exactly clear.  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware.  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Battle lines being drawn,  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.  
Some people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind.  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
What a field day for the heat,  
There's a thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly saying, ""Hooray for our kind!""  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Paranoia strikes deep,  
Into your life it will creep.  
It starts when you're always afraid,  
Get out of line, the men come and take you away.  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down.

496,Marianne Faithfull,Ghost Dance,"What is it children that falls from the sky?  
Tayi, taya, tayi, aye ya.  
Mannah from Heaven from most high,  
Food from the Father, tayi, taye ya.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the grief.  
  
Peace to your brother, give and take heed,  
Tayi, taya, it left two feet.  
One foot extended, snake to the ground,  
Wave of the Earth, one turn around.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again,shake out the grief, babe.  
  
Stretch out your arms now dip and sway,  
Fruit of thy bird, tayi, taya.  
Threw off your shoe, haul off the sow,  
Dust off the words that shape from the tale.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again,  
We shall live again, shake out the ghost dance.  
  
Here we are, Father, here, Holy Ghost,  
Bread of your bread, host of your host.  
We are the tears that fall from your eyes,  
Word of your word, cry of your cry.  
  
We shall live again, we shall live again.  
We shall live again, we shall live.  
  
What is it, Father, in your eye,  
What is this grave sign, eyes to cry.  
Blood of my baby, well, just what I need.  
What is it, hide me, way off to speed.  
  
Who is it, Father, holy that night?  
What is it, Father, that moves to the right?  
What is it, Father, isn't it pain?  
What is it, Father, that shapes from your main?  
  
What is it, Father, supposed to be brave?  
A lot of questions, the right to live  
What is it, baby, I can't do.  
Your mama loves you, I'm dying, too.  
  
I won't forget you, never lie  
I'll always love you till I die

"
497,Marianne Faithfull,Gloomy Sunday,"Sunday is Gloomy,  
My hours are slumberless,  
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless  
Little white flowers will never awaken you  
  
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you  
Angels have no thought of ever returning you  
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Sunday is gloomy  
With shadows I spend it all  
My heart and I have decided to end it all  
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad,  
I know, let them not weep,  
Let them know that I'm glad to go  
  
Death is no dream,  
For in death I'm caressing you  
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
I wake and I find you  
Asleep in the deep of  
My heart  
Dear  
  
Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you  
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you  
Gloomy Sunday

498,Marianne Faithfull,Gluttony,"Family  
  
We've gotten word from Philadelphia  
Anna's doing well, she's making lots of money.  
Her contract has been signed to do a solo turn,  
It forbids her ever eating when or what she likes to eat,  
She likes to eat, she likes to eat.  
  
Those are hard terms for little Anna,  
Who has always been very greedy.  
Oh if she does not break her contract!  
There's no market for hippos in Philadelphia!  
  
Every single day they weigh her,  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
They have principles to stand by:  
It's a hundred-and-eighteen that were signed for -  
Only for the weight agreed we pay!  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble,  
More than that would mean disaster!  
  
But our Anna is not all that stupid  
And she knows a contract is a contract  
So she'll reason: After all  
You still can eat like little Anna  
In Louisiana - Crabmeat! Porkchops!  
Sweet-corn! Chicken!  
And those golden biscuits spread with honey!  
  
Think of our house in Louisiana!  
Look - it's growing! More and more it needs you!  
Therefore curb your craving! Gluttons will be punished!  
Curb your craving, Anna! Gluttons never go to Heaven!

"
499,Marianne Faithfull,Go Away From My World,"Go away from my world,  
Let me dream alone.  
And you see it never worked from the start,  
All I got for all of my love was a broken heart.  
Go away from my world,  
And let me dream alone.  
I'll dry my eyes and comb my hair,  
And I'll pretend you're never there.  
Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadly  
You never could understand the love I wanted so badly.  
Go away from my world,  
And let me walk all alone.  
All alone in my room,  
All alone and so sad.  
I can dream of how I wanted us to be  
Dreams I have the kind I knew could ever be.  
Go away from my world.  

"
500,Marianne Faithfull,Good Guy,"(bert's blues)  
I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time.  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been singing in the evening,  
Flying through the night.  
But I hurt my good guy,  
I hope he makes out right,  
Flying through the night.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
Been drinking down the rain.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
It makes me wonder when  
I'll see him again.  
You know time could bring a change, man,  
It ain't for me to say.  
You'll soon be out of range, man,  
This could only be the way  
It's meant to be.  
Fairy castle stark and black in the moonlight,  
The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion.  
Seagulls fly across my mind forever.  
Sadly goes the wind on it's way to hades.  
Would I, should I, could I be a stranger ?  
I shall walk right by and sigh good-bye.  
I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to blow my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been looking, you know I've been looking,  
You better believe I've been looking.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
I've been drinking down the rain.  
I've been thinking of the sunshine,  
I've been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
Blow my mind  
As well as my time,  
Blow my mind ...

501,Marianne Faithfull,Great Expectations,"Great expectations I have to find  
I want to tell you what it was like  
My recollection is not too clear  
So much hope and so much fear  
  
Long conversations into the night  
Not like that, oh no, not so black and white  
The great temptation's to try and please you  
Play with you thought and mind, and tease you  
If I could tell my story in a song  
I'd have to make it fast, yes, it's very long  
Many shades of gray between the right and wrong  
  
Day for night, night for day  
All the stories on this way  
Feel the fire burn away  
  
So turn the lights down low, come over here  
Stay with me, don't go, you'll see my characters appear  
The storyteller's magic doesn't lie  
He'll make you laugh to make you cry  
Real for me is real for you  
What I say is almost true  
  
Day for night, night for day  
All the stories on its way  
Feel the fire burn and play  
  
The story's ended, now you're on your own  
Let's say a little prayer, go home

502,Marianne Faithfull,Green Are Your Eyes,"Green are your eyes  
In the morning when you rise.  
Don't you be afraid, my love,  
To lie by me,  
Your father will not know.  
Love can be broken  
Though no words are spoken.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me my love,  
Your father will not know.  
Love, don't cry  
I'll not try.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love,  
Your father will not know.  
Yes love, don't you cry,  
I'll not try.  
Don't you be afraid to lie  
By me, my love.  
Your father will be told someday  
About our wedding day.

To cast me off discourteously

Greensleeves was my heart of gold

A heart of wanton vanity  
So i must laddie think alone  
Upon your insincerity.

Right or wrong, and he needs me, too.

Not a thing I can do  
  
But hold him,  
Hold him forever.  
Be with him now  
Tomorrow and all of my life.  
  
When love comes so strong  
There is no right or wrong.  
Your love is your own.

And what was in those ships all three,  
On Christmas day in the morning?

On Christmas day, on Christmas day,

For as long as you will have me  
Close to you, I'll stay  
  
What I wouldn't give to hold you tight  
Never, never let you out of sight  
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning  
The last one you kiss goodnight  
  
If I never get to love you  
It won't be that I didn't care  
There is nothing that I want more  
Or I need more  
  
And my heart would surely break in two  
If I never get to love you  
What I wouldn't give to hold you tight  
Never, never let you out of sight  
  
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning  
The last one you kiss goodnight  
If I never get to love you

There is one love I should never have crossed.  
He was a boy in a million, my friend,  
I should have known he would win in the end.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a loser  
And I lost someone who's near to me.  
I'm a loser  
And I'm not what I appear to be.  
  
Although I laugh and I act like a clown,  
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown.  
My tears are falling like rain from the sky,  
Is it for him or myself that I cry ?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What have I done to deserve such a fate ?  
I realize I have left it too late  
And so it's true pride comes before a fall,  
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all.

I'm a loser.

He's the kind of guy who's not too shy  
And I can tell he's my kind of guy.  
He danced close to me like I hoped he would, whoa yeah,  
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good.

We only danced for a minute or two,  
He stuck to me the whole night through.  
Last night we fell in love,  
He's everything I'm dreamin' of...  
  
He walked me home and I held his hand  
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand  
So I asked to see him again and he said I could.

Lisa left you  
Years ago.  
  
My eyes are not blue,  
But mine won't leave you  
Till the sunlight  
Has touched your face.  
  
She was your morning light,  
Her smile told of no night.  
Your love for her grew  
With each rising sun.  
  
And then one winter day  
His hand laid her away,  
She left you here  
Drowning in your tears,  
Here, where you've stayed for years,  
Crying,

511,Marianne Faithfull,I'm On Fire,"I'm on fire  
When I was young  
Just for you  
And my heart was pure  
Such desire  
I only wanted love  
Just for you  
I had allure  
Still on fire  
High heels ideals  
Just for you  
And not much fear  
My desire  
It's easy  
Still for you  
To make love appear.  
  
And then something sent me  
For what they had meant to do  
Whatever happened to you?  
  
I'm on fire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
No more pain  
Such desire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
  
And love did come  
But in such disguise -  
That I could  
Hardly recognise!  
  
I'm on fire  
So with trust in fate  
Just for you.  
And love of life  
Such desire  
Take my chance  
Just for you.  
Roll the dice.  
  
And whatever sent me  
I'll still be here for you.  
Whatever happens, it's true.  
  
And I'm standing still  
Try to show the way  
Try to change the stage.  
  
I only had to find the key  
Surely love would come to me  
You'd look into my glittering eyes  
And everything will be all right.  
  
And so time passed.  
I began to change.  
I found that I  
Could love again.  
  
I'm on fire  
At first it feels  
Just for you.  
A little strange -  
Such desire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
No more pain.  
Still on fire  
Happiness  
Still on fire  
No more pain.  
Still on fire  
Happiness  
Still on fire  
No more pain.  
Still on fire

512,Marianne Faithfull,In The Night Time,"(hampstead incident)  
Standing by the everyman, digging the rigging on my sail  
Rain to the sound of harpsichords, to the spell of fairy tale.  
The heath was hung in magic mist, enchanted dripping glades,  
I'll taste a taste until my mind drifts from this scene and fades  
In the night time.  
Crystals sparkles in the grass, I polish them with thought.  
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught.  
Fortunes told in grains of sand, here I am is all I know.  
Candy stuck in children's hair, everywhere I go  
In the night time.  
Crystals sparkles in the grass, I polish them with thought.  
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught.  
Fortunes told in grains of sand, here I am is all I know  
Candy stuck in children's hair, everywhere I go  
In the night time.  
In the night time.

513,Marianne Faithfull,Incarceration Of A Flower Child,"Do you remember me ? how we used to be helpless and happy and blind ?  
Sunk without hope in a haze of good dope and cheap wine ?  
Laying on the living-room floor on those indian tapestry cushions you made  
Thinking of calling our first born jasmine or jade.  
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me,  
Don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think
about what it might be,  
Don't get up to open the door, just stay with me here on the floor,  
It's gonna get cold in the 1970's.  
You wouldn't listen, you thought you knew better, you just to had to speak to
that man.  
Please believe me, I'll visit whenever I can.  
Laying in your little white room with no windows and three square sedations a
day,  
You plead with the doctor who's running the show,  
""please don't take jasmine away and leave me alone.""  
  
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it to me,

When I have time to rest.  
All the people I love are there

Then I heard the wind  
Calling from over the sea

There is another side to this pure land,  
A side of blood and guilt and pain  
A side of enemy and friend  
And sorrow at the hearth side stain.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There is a land that I can go to  
When I have time to rest.  
All the people I love are there  
And those who love me best.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?""  
""Ireland, Ireland,  
When will you be free?""

515,Marianne Faithfull,Is This What I Get For Loving You ?,"There's been a lot of talk around  
That you've been seen with a certain party  
And now I'm so afraid I'm losing you  
Oh, baby don't tell me you don't want my love  
I couldn't give it to just anybody  
Baby won't you say it isn't true  
  
Don't leave me baby  
Don't tell me it's over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said you'd always love me  
You said you'd never hurt me  
  
What will there be left for me  
It's such a cruel world to be alone in  
I always needed you to look out for me  
Oh baby, I'm gonna miss your lovin' arms  
They're the only arms I feel at home in  
Don't you know how lonely I'm gonna be  
  
Don't leave me baby  
Don't tell me it's over  
After I trusted you  
And did my best to make you happy  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
Is this what I get for lovin' you baby  
There was a night when you held me tight  
And you said you'd always love me  
You said you'd never hurt me

"
516,Marianne Faithfull,Isolation,"Don't they know we're so afraid,  
Isolation.  
We're afraid to be alone  
Everbody's got to have a home  
Isolation.  
  
Just a boy and a little girl  
Trying to change the whole wide world,  
Isolation.  
The world is just a little town  
Everybody trying to put us down,  
Isolation.  
  
I don't expect you to understand  
After you caused so much pain  
But then again you're not to blame  
You're just a human, a victim of the insane.  
  
We're afraid of everyone  
Afraid of the sun,  
Isolation.  
The sun will never disappear  
But the world may not have many years,  
Isolation

517,Marianne Faithfull,It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,"As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playing  
That old song about the wild, wild side of life.  
As I listen to the words you are saying,  
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you say in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women,  
It's not true that only you, men, feel the same.  
From the start most every heart that's been broken  
Was because there always was a man to blame.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.  
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels  
As you said in the words of your song.  
Too many times married men think they're still single  
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.

518,Marianne Faithfull,I've Done It Again,"I was on the first ship to Peru,  
Charted all the courses like all sailors do,  
First to cross the Mason-Dixon line,  
Overseein' wetbacks for good California wine.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
I was there when Jan and Liford sang,  
First to feel the cold Alaskan white man,  
First to take a trip on lsd,  
First to vote for Roosevelt back in '33.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
Yes I've seen it, yes I've seen it,  
And deep inside you're brave,  
You know I mean it, yes I mean it.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again,  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.  
  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again,  
And I've done it again, done it again, done it again.

519,Marianne Faithfull,Jaberwock,"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.  
All mimsey were the borogroves  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  
""Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  
The jaws that bite, the claws that snatch!  
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun  
The frumious Bandersnatch! ""  
He took his vorpal sword in hand:  
Long time the manxome foe he sought -  
He rested 'neath the Tumtum tree,  
And stood awhile in thought.  
And while in uffish thought he stood,  
The Jabberwock, with eyes aflame  
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,  
And burbled as it came!  
One, two! One, two! And through and through  
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  
He left it dead, and with it's head  
He went galumphing back.  
""And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?  
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!  
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! ""  
He chortled in his joy.  
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.  
All mimsey were the borogroves  
And the mome raths outgrabe.

520,Marianne Faithfull,Last Song,"Lost his own, taken down  
All his songs  
Till his all alone  
And all our love was harmed  
'cept for you  
I'm only young, favorite son  
Say you tried, take it back  
To where you belong  
And all the things you say  
  
Still untrue  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lovely homes  
Do what you want to do!  
I was digging up, sorting out,  
Only to built a song alone  
Till you came along  
But all my love was there  
Just all for you  
And in the darkest time  
We crossed the line  
Made a song  
Cause all the talk was wrong  
And all you ever won  
  
Can still be true  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into stone  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lovely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into stone  
Such lonely stone  
Now all my love is out  
It's just for you  
It's not a love song  
It's the last song for you

"
521,Marianne Faithfull,Lies,"How come you don't realise the shape you're in  
Sweatin' over lies to justify the naked sin within  
A spineless irritation from some time before  
When more than life was cursin' through my veins.  
  
You made me and you slayed me and you tortured me  
Laughing as you lay upon our bed of bloody love - and left me.  
Think about me, drink about me, I don't care,  
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.  
  
If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,  
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.  
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,  
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.  
  
Across the street they're eating now and holding hands,  
An image of a priest with bibles lain across his hands for me.  
Don't think about me, drink about me, I don't care,  
'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in.  
  
If I was alive, I'd open up the gates for you,  
If I'd only cried aloud, I'd still be here.  
In my other life, I'm making plans for you, my dear,  
So come on babe, your time is drawing near.  
  
In the house, my mother's house, the clocks have all stood still,  
An empty picture frame upon a dirty window sill.  
In the yard, my father's yard, a tombstone breaks in two,  
Shattered by a lying snake like you.

"
522,Marianne Faithfull,Like Being Born,"My father promised me roses  
My mother promised me thorns  
My father taught me to use my mind  
My mother taught me scorn  
He touches me lightly with his hand  
It feels like being born [Repeat: x3]  
  
My father promised me green trees  
My mother promised me stars  
I hardly seen the love I have  
It all goes by so fast  
He kisses me gently with his lips  
It's near what once was far [Repeat: x3]

523,Marianne Faithfull,Lonesome Traveller,"I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm just a lonely and a lonesome traveller  
I'm travelling on.  
Travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
Well, I've travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,  
Travelled in the mountains, travelled in the valley,

"
524,Marianne Faithfull,Long Black Veil,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night,  
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light.  
There were few at the scene but they all did agree  
That the man who ran looked a lot like me.  
  
[Chorus]  
She walks these hills in a long black veil.  
She visits my grave where the night winds wail.  
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees,  
Nobody knows but me.  
  
The judge said, ""Son what is your alibi ?  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die.""  
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,  
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The scaffold is high and eternity nears  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear.  
But sometimes at night where the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries all o'er my bones.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nobody knows but me.

525,Marianne Faithfull,Losing,"You know I see you when you're sleeping  
When you're all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby  
But you've been losing  
  
You know there's clearer ways of thinking  
And there's quicker ways of dying  
But I'm a sucker for your drinking  
And now, I'm losing  
  
I don't know who you think you're cheating  
Or with whom you have been sleeping  
But all the shit that you've been eating  
Says you're losing  
  
When I let my hate pervert me  
And there's no more tears for crying  
I'll just kill you if you hurt me  
I'll kill you  
  
You know I see you when you're sleeping  
When you're all insane with dreaming  
I can tell you that you been fighting, baby  
Fighting hard and losing  
  
Fighting hard, and losing  
Fighting hard, fighting hard, losing

"
526,Marianne Faithfull,Love And Money,"Is it a crisis ?  
Is it a crime ?  
Or is it a fantasy ?  
Does it take time ?  
Will it cost money ?  
Will it mean love ?  
Sure isn't easy  
To get in the mood  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha.  
  
See you at the parties  
You're never the same  
Do you make money ?  
What is your name ?  
Where can I find you ?  
Out in the night  
Who are your friends ?  
Are they dark or light ?  
  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha  
Aha.  
  
Tell me the dreams you never told anyone  
Gimme a break.  
Are you really a virgin who's never loved anyone else ?  
Or just a fake ?  
Me I don't know what to think anymore  
Don't know where to start  
To sit here with you and talk about nothing  
Is breaking my heart.  
  
Ask me a question ?  
Gimme a smoke  
What are you drinking ?  
Is it a joke  
Well ain't it worth it ?  
Or am I depraved ?  
You hold your head high  
With one foot in the grave.  
  
Aha  
Aha.  
Aha  
Aha.

527,Marianne Faithfull,Love In The Afternoon,"It's getting dark outside  
Daytime is done.  
The lights along the river come up  
One by one.  
Let's make love again  
We got time.  
I am yours  
You are mine.  
It's getting dark outside  
I have to go.  
Don't want my husband  
Or my friends to know.  
Zip up my dress  
  
I can't find my shoes.  
Don't fall in love with me  
Too much to lose.  
The kids are home by now  
Have to think fast.  
I really think this afternoon  
Must be the last.  
Don't say anything,  
Don't turn on the light.  
Thanks for loving me,  
Call you tonight.

"
528,Marianne Faithfull,Love Is Teasin',"I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
I wish I were a maid again.  
But a maid again I can never be  
Until apples grow on an ivy tree.  
For love it is pleasin' and love is teasin'  
And love is a treasure when first it's new.  
But as love grows older, then love grows colder  
And it fades away like the morning dew.  
There is a little house into town  
And there my love, he sits him down.  
He takes a strange girl on his knee  
And he tells her things that he wants to be.  
For love and water make younger older  
And love and whiskey make her old and grey.  
And what cannot be cured, love, must be endured, love,  
And now I am bound for America.  
La la la la la la ...  
La la la la la la ...  
As life grows older sure love grows older  
And it fades away like the morning dew.

"
529,Marianne Faithfull,Mad About The Boy,"I met him at a party just a couple of years ago,  
He was rather over-hearty and ridiculous  
But as I'd seen him on the screen he cast a certain spell.  
I'd basked in his attraction  
For a couple of hours or so.  
His manners were a fraction too meticulous,  
If he was real or not, I couldn't tell,  
But like a silly fool I fell  
  
Mad about the boy,  
I know it's stupid  
To be mad about the boy.  
I'm so ashamed of it  
But must admit  
The sleepless nights  
I've had about the boy.  
  
On the silver screen  
He melts my foolish heart  
In every single scene.  
Although I'm quite aware  
That here and there  
Are traces of that cared about the boy.  
Lord knows I'm not a fool girl,  
I really shouldn't care.  
Lord knows I'm not a schoolgirl  
In the flurry of her first affair.  
Will it ever cloy  
This odd diversity of misery and joy  
I'm feeling quite insane  
And young again  
And all because  
I'm mad about the boy.  
  
It seems a little silly  
For a girl of my age and weight  
To walk down piccadilly in a haze of light.  
It ought to take her a good deal more  
To take a bad girl down.  
I should've been exempt for my particular kind of fate  
As taught me such contempt for every phase of love  
And now I've been and spent my love torn crown  
To weep about a painted clown.  
  
Mad about the boy,  
It's pretty funny  
But I'm mad about the boy.  
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel  
There's maybe something sad about the boy.  
  
Walking down the street  
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet.  
I can't believe it's true,  
But when I'm blue, in some strange way  
I'm glad about the boy.  
  
I'm hardly sentimental,  
Love isn't so sublime.  
I have to pay my rental  
And I can't afford to waste much time.  
If I could employ a little magic  
That would finally destroy  
This dream that pains me and it shames me  
But I can't because I'm mad about the boy.

"
530,Marianne Faithfull,Monday Monday,"Monday morning  
It was all I hoped it would be.  
Oh Monday morning,  
Monday morning couldn't guarantee  
That Monday evening  
You would still be here with me.  
  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Every other day  
Of the week is fine, yeah.  
  
But whenever Monday comes  
But whenever Monday comes  
You can find me crying  
All of the time.  
  
Monday, Monday,  
Can't trust the day.

531,Marianne Faithfull,Morning Comes,"When will the morning come?  
I wait in darkness so long.  
Will the sun ever rise again?  
  
Hours flowing over me  
I wait in vain for some change.  
Will light ever pierce this pain?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast.  
  
How will the morning be?  
I watched the dawn in my dreams  
And imagined the day for years.  
Shall I feel warmth again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast.  
  
Tell me please,  
  
How will it come  
This release,  
A crack in the door.  
  
Shall I feel warm again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears?  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea.  
Morning light shine on me.  
  
Oh, tell me please, how will she come  
Surrounding me, the opening door?  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east.  
May the pilgrim join in the feast  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea.  
Morning light shine on me.  
  
Riding on a humming bird's wing,  
Caravans fleeing from the east...

532,Marianne Faithfull,Morning Sun,"I see the morning sun  
Coming over the hill,  
Sorrow and pain for me  
Coming over the hill.  
I'm very sad Lost love for me  
But I will love again.  
I know a man  
Who breaks every heart that he can.  
I know him well  
For I have been hurt by this man.  
I'm very sad,  
Tears follow me,  
But I will love again.  
I'm very sad,  
Tears follow me,  
But I will love again.  
I know a man  
Who promises that he'll be true  
And I look back once again,  
Well, what else could I do ?  
I'm very sad  
But he is true  
And we will love again.  
I see the morning sun  
Coming over the hill.  
I see him and he says  
That he'll stay  
And he will.  
I'm sad no more,  
He comforts me  
And we will love again.

Oh, Mud Slime and depending on you.  
I don't know but I've been told  
There's a time from time to time  
I can't eat, I can't sleep  
But I just like to move my feet  
'Cause there's nothing like the sound of sweet soul music  
To change your lady's mind  
And there's nothing like a walk on down by the bayou  
To leave the world behind.  
Mud Slime, I'm depending on you,  
Mr. Mud Slime Slim on the blue horizon.  
I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,  
Yes, I'm letting the time go by, letting the time go by.  
I wanted cash in my hand  
Pick upon a piece of land  
Build myself a cabin back in the woods.  
Lord, it's there I'm gonna stay  
Until there comes a day  
When this old world starts changing for the good.  
Now the reason I'm smiling  
Is over on an island  
On a hillside in the woods where I belong.  
I wanna thank Jimmy Jimmy John and Mick and Robbie  
Of Nojets Construction to send me down homestead on a farm.  
Oh, Mud Slime, I'm depending on you.

"
536,Marianne Faithfull,North Country Maid,"A North country maid up to London has strayed  
Although with her nature it did not agree.  
So she wept and she sighed and bitterly she cried,  
""Oh, I wish once again in the North I could be.""  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow green in the North country.  
While sadly I roam I regret my dear home,  
Where the lads and young lasses are making the hay.  
Where the birds sweetly sing, and the merry bells do ring  
And the maidens and meadows are pleasant and gay.  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow green in the North country.  
No doubt if I please, I could marry with ease,  
Where maidens are fair, many lovers will come.  
But he that I wed must be North country bred  
And carry me back to my own country.  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow so green in the North country.

And we, like the others,  
Will forget in our sleep,  
Will forget in our sleep.""

540,Marianne Faithfull,Paris Bells,"Past the cafe shutters down,  
No one stirs in the town.  
  
The morning after the rain  
The barges move on the Seine.  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.  
  
Dawn is breaking, birds start to sing,  
Sun is rising, warms everything.  
  
The echo of footsteps on a cobbled street,  
Dim alleyways where the shadows meet.  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.  
  
The places where we used to visit,  
The chapel where we went to wed.  
  
Paris bells on the breeze  
Often stir memories.  
  
We both knew the morning rain  
We both wandered down the Seine.  
  
Now you're gone away from me  
You're just a memory  
Like the bells ring on the breeze,  
Paris bells ring on the breeze.

541,Marianne Faithfull,Penthouse Serenade,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky  
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by  
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I  
When we're alone  
  
From all of society, we'll stay aloof  
And live in propriety there on the roof  
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth  
When we're alone  
  
We'll see life's mad pattern  
As we view old Manhattan  
Then we can thank our lucky stars  
That we're living as we are  
  
In our little penthouse, we'll always contrive  
To keep love and romance forever alive  
In view of the Hudson just over the drive  
When we're alone  
  
We can thank our lucky stars

542,Marianne Faithfull,Pirate Jenny,"You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors  
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking  
Maybe once you tip me and it makes you feel swell  
In this crummy southern town in this crummy old hotel  
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.  
No, you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'  
Then one night there's a scream in the night  
And you wonder who could that have been?  
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'  
And you say, ""What's she got to grin?"" I'll tell you  
There's a ship, The Black Freighter  
With a skull on its masthead will be coming in  
You gentlemen can say, ""Hey gal, finish them floors!  
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you? Earn your keep here!?  
You toss me your tips and look out to the ships  
But I'm counting your heads as I'm making the beds  
'cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, tonight  
Nobody is going to sleep here honey  
Nobody, nobody!  
Then one night there's a scream in the night  
And you say, ""Who's that kicking up a row?""  
And you see me kinda starin' out the window  
And you say, ""What's she got to stare at now?""  
I'll tell you  
There's a ship, The Black Freighter turns around in the harbor  
Shootin' guns from her bow  
Now, you gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face  
'Cause every building in town is a flat one  
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground  
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound  
And you yell, ""Why do they spare that one?""  
Yes, that's what you say, ""Why do they spare that one?""  
All the night through, through the noise and to do  
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?  
And you see me stepping out in the morning  
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair  
And the ship, The Black Freighter runs a flag up its masthead  
And a cheer rings the air  
By noontime the dock is a swarmin' with men  
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter  
They're movin' in the shadows where no one can see  
And they're chainin' up people and they're bringin' 'em to me  
Askin' me, ""Kill them now, or later?""  
Askin' me, ""Kill them now, or later?""  
Noon by the clock and so still by the dock  
You can hear a foghorn miles away  
And in that quiet of death, I'll say, ""Right now, right now!""  
Then they'll pile up the bodies  
And I'll say, ""That'll learn ya!""  
And the ship, The Black Freighter disappears out to sea  
And on it is me

And maybe one day I will free her  
Though I know no-one can see her.

And withered into lovely dust.  
How beautiful great babylon.

The night will fall, the price we'll pay,  
Such beauty's not all it's cracked up to be,  
So let us praise such luxury.  
Behold the man, the bold macheath,  
The end's in sight, I fear.  
If he had kept his pretty head  
And just robbed the rich, but oh no, instead  
All's come to nought and turned to dust.  
How sad the heart when it has won.  
Watch out the world is spinning fast,  
The night will fall, the price we'll pay.

What can she do,

So softly she entered that her feet made no din  
And she turned her head to me and this she did say

Is it really darkest before dawn?  
Will I see whiskey as a Mother in the end?  
In the end will I smash my brains with drinking?  
Till I fall down on the floor  
Will I hiccup and jabber  
Saying things I never meant?  
Will I kiss and cry and wake to find  
A sordid stranger by my bed?  
Will the world shake its sensible head  
And say the words that have to be said?  
She's got a problem  
Every problem has solution in the end  
And solutions must be final  
For help gets so unhelpful near the end

The missing pieces that you lost  
Best that you refuse to weep  
Ash to ash, dust to dust.  
  
It is strange to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
Strange to shelter under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is safe to walk with me  
Where you can read the sky and stars,  
Safe to walk upon the sea  
In my sleep we can go far.  
  
It is safe to sleep alone  
In a place no one knows  
And to shelter under stones  
In a place water flows.  
  
It is strange to sleep alone  
In a place no one goes,  
Strange to seek life under stones.  
In my sleep no one knows.

560,Marianne Faithfull,Sliding Through Life On Charm,"The family tree was chainsawed Wednesday week  
So now I have to mingle with the meek  
Hey mister, you have finally met your match  
Now everybody wants to kiss my snatch  
  
To go where God knows who has gone before  
I am a muse, not a mistress, not a whore  
Oh, suburban shits who want some class  
All queue up to kiss my ass  
  
And I was only trying to please  
I never got any royalties oh no, not me  
I'm still sliding through life on charm  
Sliding through life on charm  
  
If Marianne was born a man she'd show you all  
A way to piss your life against the wall  
Go ahead why don't you leave me to these thugs  
And creeps who want to fuck a nun on drugs?  
  
Is it such a sin I never ever tried too hard?  
I had to know how far was going too far  
In proper homes throughout the land, Fathers try to understand  
Why Eunice who is seventeen aspires to live her life like me  
  
Oh no, can't ya see, Daddy?  
She's just captivated by my charm  
Sliding through life on charm  
  
Sliding  
Sliding  
Never  
  
I wonder why the schools don't teach anything useful nowadays  
Like how to fall from grace and slide with elegance from a pedestal  
I never asked to be on in the first place  
  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm, sliding on charm  
Sliding on charm

564,Marianne Faithfull,Sunny Goodge Street,"On the firefly platform of sunny goodge street  
A violent hash-smoker shook a chocolate machine  
Involved in an eating scene  
Smashing into neon streets in their stillness  
Smearing their eyes on the crazy kali goddess  
Listening to sounds of mingus mellow fantastic.  
""my, my"", they sigh.  
In dull house rooms with coloured lights swinging  
Strange music boxes sadly tinkling  
Drink in the sun shining all around you.  
""my, my"", they sigh.  
The magician, he sparkles in satin and velvet,  
You gaze at his splendour with eyes you've not used yet.  
I tell you his name is love, love, love.  
""my, my"", they sigh.  
""my, my"", so high.

565,Marianne Faithfull,Surabaya Johnny,"I had just turned sixteen that season  
When you came up from Burma to stay.  
And you told me I ought to travel with you,  
You were sure it would be OK.  
When I asked how you earned your living,  
I can still hear what you said to me:  
You had some kind of job on the railway  
And had nothing to do with the sea.  
  
You said a lot, Johnny,  
All one big lie, Johnny.  
You cheated me blind, Johnny,  
From the minute we met.  
I hate you so, Johnny,  
When you stand there grinning, Johnny.  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth, you rat.  
  
Surabaya Johnny,  
No one's meaner than you.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
My God and I still love you so.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
Why am I feeling so blue ?  
You have no heart, Johnny,  
And I still love you so.  
  
At the start, every day was Sunday,  
Till we went on our way one fine night.  
And before two more weeks were over,  
You thought nothing I did was right.  
So we trekked up and down through the Punjab,  
From the source of the river to the sea.  
When I look at my face in the mirror,  
There's an old woman staring back at me.  
  
You didn't want love, Johnny,  
You wanted cash, Johnny.  
But I sewed your lips, Johnny,  
And that was that.  
You wanted it all, Johnny,  
I gave you more, Johnny.  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth, you rat.  
  
Surabaya Johnny.  
No one's meaner than you.  
Surabaya Johnny.  
My God and I still love you so.

Why am I feeling so blue ?  
You have no heart, Johnny.  
And I still love you so.

How you'd got that peculiar name,  
But from one end of the coast to the other  
You were known everywhere we came.  
And one day I

Looking forward to being with you.  
Got in to the broadway and what do I find ?  
Some lady's been sleeping there, too.  
I was dreamin' of our meetin' all down the m1  
'cause I hadn't seen you for so long.  
Then out of the blue, something came down and warned me  
And I sat there and wrote down this song.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day I laughed till I cried.  
That was the day all my dreams turned to ashes  
And I lost my blues and I smiled.  
Well, I walked in the door and I heard you two laughing,  
Just like I'd hoped that we'd do.  
So I went up the stairs, left your keys on the table,  
And I wrote on the mirror, 'we're through!'.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day that I had, honey.  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
And I've got the blues out just bad.  
Going home on a train, going back to my mother,  
Feeling better already, keep telling myself:  
'don't you cry, you'll forget him and find a new lover,  
So let's sit back and drink to his health.'  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville,  
That was the day I laughed till I cried.  
That was the day that I felt my heart breaking,

Good night baby,  
But may I ask you why?  
  
I gave you everything I had

While you're waiting all alone

It would only take a minute of your time  
To spare one thought for me  
Would you miss just one minute of your time?  
  
When you are far away  
I'd like to be part of your time each day  
So think of me  
  
A minute of your time  
Is all it takes to bring us close  
When we are far apart  
  
And if I'm on your mind  
I know that there's a chance  
You'll find that I'm right there in your heart  
One minute ev'ry day  
May help to keep the wolf away  
Until that moment you are back to stay  
But better still I'd like to think you think of me  
Ev'ry minute of your time

Wonderful feelings, I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
Silent, sweet surrender  
A broken heart remembers the first time  
Last moments sweet and tender  
Cold and dying embers when love dies  
  
In the quiet of the mist  
When two lovers kissed the very last time  
But we're right here tonight  
It's love at first sight and we're doing alright  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
Mexican morning, we danced until dawn  
In the moonlight  
In blue Acapulco, nobody that we know  
Is just right  
No thought of tomorrow  
And sorrow is clear out of sight  
But right here tonight  
Love is alright  
And we're lost in the light

Wonderful feelings I just can't hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire

And may it always remind you of  
A taste of honey

574,Tom Jones,A Woman's Touch,"Right from the first day one man stood alone  
And somehow he missed what didn't exist how could he have known  
He looked all around him and lifted his head  
For he heard a voice and rose to rejoice as somebody said  
  
This place needs a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
Up through the ages, the story's the same  
A king to himself, alone with his wealth is living in vain  
His castle will crumble and he'll wonder why  
'Cause wealthy or poor, there's one thing for sure, he just can't deny  
  
The need of a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For without a woman's touch  
Life don't mean much to a man  
  
I was a drifter who couldn't be tamed  
So reckless and wild but lost like a child  
Whose dreams never came  
  
Then I felt the pleasures of love's happiness  
One look in her eyes and I realized  
I've truly been blessed  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man  
  
Thank God for a woman's touch  
To share in the plan  
For it took my woman's touch  
To make me feel like a man

Some men search for silver some for gold  
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey

How could I hurt you  
When Darlin' I love you  
And you know, I'd never, never hurt you  
  
What do you think  
I would give At This Moment  
If you'd stay, I'd subtract  
Twenty years from my life  
I'd fall down on my knees  
Kiss the ground that you walk on  
If I could just hold you again

581,Tom Jones,Autumn Leaves,"The falling leaves pass by my window  
The autumn leaves of red and gold  
I see your lips your summer kisses  
The sunburned hands I used to know  
Um since you went away  
The days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter's song  
Oh, but I'll miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall  
Oh I said I miss you most of all  
My darling when autumn leaves  
Start to fall

582,Tom Jones,Baby It's Cold Outside,"I really can't stay  
But baby, it?s cold outside  
I've got to go away  
Ahh, baby, it?s cold outside  
  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I?ll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to that fireplace roar  
  
So really I?d better scurry  
Oh beautiful, please don't hurry  
Maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
Oh baby, it?s bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink  
There's no cabs to be had out there  
  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I?ll take your hat, your hair looks well  
  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir  
Mind if I move a little closer  
At least there'll be, oh, that I tried  
What's the sense of hurting my pride  
  
I really can't stay  
Baby, don't hold out  
Ahh, but it?s cold outside  
Yeah  
  
I simply must go  
Oh, baby, it?s cold outside  
The answer is no  
You know it?s cold outside  
  
This welcome has been  
I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious  
Oh, your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Like waves upon a tropical shore  
  
My maiden aunt?s mind is vicious  
Eww, your lips are delicious  
Well maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to go home  
Ahh, baby, you would freeze out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
You know it?s up to your knees out there  
  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see?  
How can you do this thing to me  
  
there's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
  
I really can't stay  
Get over and hold out  
Ahh, but it?s cold outside, yeah  
  
Bloody, freezin' ain't it

583,Tom Jones,Bad Love,"I've known bad women

Tasted bad food and bad water  
And I've read about bad rain

With an ironclad guarantee  
'Cause I ain't never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love

As long as it ain't square  
To be bad music is don't move  
Too smooth, no groove happening there

All of them got me hurt  
Some of them women that seemed sweet  
Complete, they treat you like dirt

But I ain't never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love  
I never really seen no bad love  
No bad love, no bad love

I saw one just last night  
Ain't got no action, and it ain't got no plot  
That's not what I like  
  
You can even get a bad education  
But that won't get you nowhere  
But somebody's gonna say  
That school ain't cool  
What fool wants to go there  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I've had bad days and had bad nights  
But I never had me no bad love  
And a Cadillac Fleetwood with a bad ride  
But I never had me no bad love  
I've had bad things happen to me all my life  
But I never had me no bad love  
  
Whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, hoo  
But I never had me no bad love

Shakedown dreams walking in broad daylight  
Three hun-dred six-ty five de-grees

It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself  
Gonna come in first place  
People on their way to work baby what did you except  
Gonna burst into flame  
  
My house S'out of the ordinary  
That's might Don't want to hurt nobody  
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet

Everything's stuck together

Fighting fire with fire..

If only they could read between the lines  
  
('Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City

I need you at the dimming of the day  
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my bed aside  
  
The days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise for a broken heart  
Now all the bonny birds, have flown away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
Come tonight you're only what I want  
Come tonight you can be my comfort doll  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me  
I'm living for the night, we can steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day

Plants a kiss on the shore,  
Then rolls out to sea,  
And the sea is very still once more.  
So I rush to your side  
Like the oncoming tide,  
With one burning thought - Will your arms open wide?  
At last we're face to face,  
And as we kiss through an embrace  
I can tell, I can feel you are love, your are real.  
Really mine in the rain,  
In the dark, in the sun.  
Like the tide at its ebb,  
I'm at peace in the web of your arms.

As she brushed a tear from my cheek.

Started walkin' all over my mind.  
It's sad, so sad to watch love go bad,  
But a true love would not have gone wrong.

For without them I could not go on,  
With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings

Stop walk' all over my mind

When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw  
A ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat  
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet  
'Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' fire as they ride on hear their cry  
Yi pi yi ay yi pi yi oy the ghost riders in the sky  
  
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  
If you want to save your soul from hell a ridin' on our range  
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride  
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Will still be heard,

Hears every word,

Or touch a leaf, are see the sky,

And a yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby oh, my love since you went away  
Haven't spent a happy day  
I wake up crying after sobbin' and sighin'  
And a wonderin' just what went wrong  
Pretty baby well I know I was good to you  
Why'd you go and make me blue  
I need your arms to hold me tight now  
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight  
I'm so unhappy on my own  
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely  
(Oh, now, now, now, well, well, well, now baby)  
I tell you I wake up crying after tossin' and turnin'  
And a yearnin' the whole night long

And save me from this misery I want you to save me  
Ah save me baby

Adore you, and want you so  
I'm just a no one,  
With nothing to give you but Oh  
I Love You  
  
He, He buys you diamonds  
Bright, sparkling diamonds  
But believe me, dear when I say,  
That he can give you the world,  
But he'll never love you the way  
I Love You  
  
He can take you anyplace he wants  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
  
I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no one  
Must watch you, go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else  
When darling it's I  
Who Loves you  
  
I Love You  
I Love You  
  
I Looove Yoooou

607,Tom Jones,If He Should Ever Leave You,"Your captivating eyes  
The clever way they smile stops him in his tracks  
And add your pretty face you keep him in his place  
He'd do anything you ask  
  
They've broken the mold  
More precious than gold  
When you're standing there the world disappears  
  
It would be a crime to ever let you go  
He should be inclined to keep you very close  
No one else compares  
You're a cut above the rest  
He'd be such a fool if he should ever leave you  
  
Be careful what you do he?s so in love with you, you might tear him apart  
To watch the way you move, it?s obvious that you were made for breaking hearts  
The pout of your lips, those soft fingertips  
The curve of your waist, you?re perfectly made  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
It would be a crime to ever let you go  
He should be inclined to keep you very close  
No one else compares you?re a cut above the rest  
He'd be such a fool if he should ever leave you  
  
Your captivating eyes  
The subtle way you smile sets him in a spin  
The subtle way you smile

When these no one else around,  
  
I'm gonna take you,  
Girl and hold ya,  
And do all the things I told ya,  
In the midnight hour,

To see that twinkle in your eye,  
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,

609,Tom Jones,It's Four In The Morning,"It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin' I'd never met her, knowing if I forget her  
How much better off she would be  
  
The longer I hold on, the longer this goes on  
The harder that it's going to be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
I'd never desert her, God knows when I hurt her  
That's the last thing that I want to do  
She tries, but she can't tell how she feels  
But I know, too well, just what she's going through  
  
If I love her so much, I don't know why I can't do  
The right thing and just let her be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Last night I told her, ""This time it's all over""  
Making two times I've told her goodbye  
Last night, we broke up, this morning I woke up  
And for the fifth time, I'm changing my mind  
  
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her  
Than most foolish men will ever see  
An' it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin' I'd never met her

610,Tom Jones,It's Just A Matter Of Time,"Someday, some way, you'll realize that you've been blind  
Yes, darling, you're going to need me again  
It's just a matter of time  
Go on, go on, until you reach the end of the line  
But I know you'll pass my way again  
It's just a matter of time  
After I gave you everything I had You laughed and called me a clown  
Remember, in your search for fortune and fame  
What goes up must come down  
I know, I know that one day you'll wake up and find  
That my love was a true love  
It's just a matter of time

"
611,Tom Jones,It's Not Unusual,"It's not unusual to be loved by anyone  
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone  
But when I see you hanging about with anyone  
It's not unusual to see me cry,  
Oh I wanna' die.  
  
It's not unusual to go out at any time  
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime  
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone,  
It's not unusual  
  
It happens every day  
No matter what you say  
  
You find it happens all the time  
Love will never do what you want it to  
Why can't this crazy love be mine.  
  
It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone  
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone  
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime  
It's not unusual to find out that I'm in love with you  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

"
612,Tom Jones,Just Out Of Reach (Of My Two Empty Arms),"Love that runs away from me  
Dreams that just won't let me be  
Blues that keep on bothering me  
Chains that just won't set me free  
  
Too far away from you and all your charms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Each night in dreams I see your face  
Memories time cannot erase  
Then I awake and find you gone  
I'm so blue and all alone  
  
So far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
  
Oh honey, you know, what lonesome feeling that I have all the time  
It's just knowing that I know you'll never be mine  
And the dreams that always keeps on hurtin' me in my sleep  
I know they're only vows that you and I could never keep  
  
Too far away from lips so sweet and warm  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms  
Just out of reach of my two empty arms

You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with  
I just want your extra time and your kiss

Women, not girls, rule my world  
I said they rule my world  
Act your age woman, not your shoe size  
Maybe we could do the twirl?  
You don't have to watch Dynasty  
To have an attitude  
You just leave it all up to me  
My love will be your food  
  
You don't have to be rich to be my girl  
You don't have to be cool to rule my world  
Ain't no particular sign, I'm more compatible with,

614,Tom Jones,Let It Be,"When I find myself in times of trouble

She is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be.  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Living in the world agree,  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
And though they may be parted there is  
Still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be,  
Let it be, let it be.

There is still a light that shines on me,  
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.  
O, will I make up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Home, folks think I'm big in Detroit City.

But by day, I make the cars,  
And by night I make the bars,  
If only they could read between the lines!  
  
[Spoken]  
  
You know,  
I rode a freight train north to Detroit City.  
After all these years,  
I find that I've just been wastin' my time.  
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride,  
Put on a south bound freight and ride,  
Goin' back to the love ones,  
The ones I left waitin' so far behind.  
  
I wanna go home, I wanna go home,  
Oh, how I want to go home.

626,Tom Jones,Promise Her Anything,"He always runs while others walk  
He acts while other men just talk.  
He looks at this world, and wants it all,  
So he strikes, like thunderball.  
He knows the meaning of success.  
His needs are more, so he gives less.  
They call him the winner who takes all.  
And he strikes, like thunderball.  
  
Any woman he wants, he'll get.  
He will break any heart without regret.  
His days of asking are all gone.  
His fight goes on and on and on.  
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all.  
So he strikes like thunderball  

"
627,Tom Jones,Seasons,"Summer's gone  
It could not stay  
It ran it's path  
It's yesterday  
  
Like a moment's fire  
That lost it's burn  
It fade it fast  
And wont return  
  
[Chorus]  
So I walk on  
And make my memories  
And hope is not gone  
Because I still believe  
There's a reason for passing time  
These are the seasons of my life  
  
I've long for spring  
And the winter's cold  
I felt the sing  
Of the unknown  
My frozen heart  
Held me bound  
Until the time  
It turn around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There more I live  
Then more I grows  
No more than this is  
Is all I know  
For time as run  
But I don't mind  
For life's begone  
Once more inside  
  
[Chorus]

"
628,Tom Jones,Seen That Face,"I forgot how much it hurts, to see you cry  
And just how inconsistent the world seems when you smile  
There was a little kiss in the back of the car  
Looking right at me, his eyes spells with the stars  
I felt so happy and so true  
In that moment he remind me of you  
  
I've seen that face looking back at me  
It's like a mirror reflecting everything  
A faded distant memory  
Pulling at my heart  
  
I wanna to protect to you, from any pain  
Keep you close to me, so you will always feel safe  
You know how much I love you, my sweet precious child  
I would do anything, I'll walk trough fire  
I see part of me in you,  
And when you look at me it all come shinning trough

631,Tom Jones,Sixteen Tons,"Some people say a man is made outta mud  
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood  
Muscle and blood and skin and bones  
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine  
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine  
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal  
And the straw boss said ""Well, a-bless my soul""  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain  
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name  
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion  
Cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
If you see me comin', better step aside  
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died  
One fist of iron, the other of steel  
If the right one don't a-get you  
Then the left one will  
  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store

634,Tom Jones,Sometimes We Cry,"Sometimes we know, sometimes we don't  
Sometimes we give, sometimes we won't  
Sometimes we're strong, sometimes we're wrong  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes it's bad when the going gets tough  
When we look in the mirror and we want to give up  
Sometimes we don't even think we'll try  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Well we're gonna have to sit down and think it through  
If we're only human what more can we do  
The only thing to do is eat humble pie  
Sometimes we cry  
  
'Fore they put me in a jacket, and they take me away  
I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we can't see anything straight  
Sometimes everybody is on the make  
Sometimes it's lonely on the lost highway  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry  
  
Gonna put me in a jacket, and take me away  
I'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry  
  
Sometimes we live, sometimes we die  
Sometimes we cry, sometimes we cry

When you're digging a ditch  
And, gods  
Revenge on the rich

Got the looks and the brakes  
Got the shirt got the shoes  
Got what it takes  
  
You've got to lay it down  
Tell me what you need  
You've got to lay it down  
Get up, up from your feet you know  
I get it down  
You wanted sorrow, want it sweet  
Daddy always gives you what is good for you

Nearly out of ammunition  
Sexual ambition

Yeah, a one man mob  
Woo-hoo  
I'm the McDaddy  
You don't send a boy to do a man's job  
  
And you make me feel  
Like I'm not alone  
I've been singing this song  
Since before you were born  
Baby, you're invited  
But your friend can't come  
He's a little too excited  
Maybe a little too young  
  
Ah baby, you're invited

638,Tom Jones,Sunny Afternoon,"In the summertime  
The taxman's taken all my dough  
And left me in my stately home  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
And I can't sail my yacht  
  
He's taken everything I've got  
All I've got's this sunny afternoon  
Save me, from this squeeze  
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me  
And I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
In the summertime  
In the summertime (everything seems fine)  
  
My girlfriend's gone off with my car  
And gone back to her ma and pa  
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty  
And now I'm sitting here  
Sipping on my ice cold beer  
  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
Help me, sail away  
Give me two good reasons why I ought to stay  
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
Everything is fine because it's the summertime  
  
In the summertime  
(I don't care about a doggone thing)  
In the summertime  
(I'm broke, I've skint, but it's the summertime)  
In the summertime  
(even though I ain't got a dime, in the summertime, I don't have a dime)  
In the summertime

639,Tom Jones,Take Me To The River,"I don' know why I love her like I do  
All the changes you put me through  
Take my money, my cigarettes  
I haven' seen the worst of it yet  
I wanna know that you'll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river, drop me in the water  
Take me to the river, dip me in the water  
I don' know why you treat me so bad  
Think of all the things we could have had  
Love is an ocean that I can't forget  
My sweet sixteen I would never regret  
  
I wanna know that you'll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river, drop me in the water  
Push me in the river, dip me in the water  
Washing me down, washing me  
Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me  
Till I can't, till I can't, till I can't take no more of it  
  
I don' know why I love you like I do  
All the troubles you put me through  
Sixteen candles there on my wall  
And here am I the biggest fool of them all  
  
I wanna know that you'll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river and drop me in the water  
Dip me in the river, drop me in the water

640,Tom Jones,The Anniversary Song,"Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed  
We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said  
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies  
Except for the few that were there in your eyes  
  
Dear, as I held you close in my arms  
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms  
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low  
""Darling, I love you so""  
  
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn  
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on  
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime  
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time  
  
Darling, I love you so  
  
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn  
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on  
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime  
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me  
  
Till the moon deserts the sky  
Till the all the seas run dry  
Till then I'll worship you  
Till the tropic sun turns cold  
Till this young world grows old  
My darling, I'll adore you  
  
You are my reason to live  
All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me  
  
Till the rivers flow upstream  
Till lovers cease to dream.  
'Til then I'm yours, be mine

That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you  
  
Wishing for something  
Other than love  
Wishing that I had  
Never known love  
Wishing I could forget  
  
Wishing that I have  
Never tasted  
Kisses that suddenly  
Are wasted  
Wishing I could forget you  
Wishing we've never met  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you  
  
If I could stop  
The willow weeping  
If I could stop  
The sun from sleeping  
Then I could stop  
The shadows creeping  
Over my love for you  
Guess I'm still  
Missing you  
  
Untrue, unfaithful

I used to think it was so complete  
I can't believe you, you've thrown it away  
I used to think we had it made  
I used to feel we would sail away  
Can you just imagine how I feel today  
Well, it seems a long time ago  
You were the lonely one  
Now it comes to letting go  
And you're the only one  
Do you know what you've done  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore  
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It really doesn't matter to me  
I guess your leaving was meant to be  
It's down to you now  
You want to be free  
Well, I hope you know which way to go  
You're on your own again  
Don't come running to me when you're the lonely one  
Remember what you've done  
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore  
It's so funny how we don't talk ..... anymore.......

646,Tom Jones,Why Can't I Cry,"Lonely am I  
Only my thoughts crowd the room  
Why can't I cry?  
  
Time passes me by  
The cold touch of dawn tells me so  
Still, I can' t cry  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
You'd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday you'd go  
  
Flames in the fire  
Can't warm the chill of my room  
Why can't I cry?  
  
Feel I want to die  
Just how much more can I take  
If I can't cry?  
  
You promised to love me and vowed  
You'd never leave me alone with a broken heart  
You treated along like a game tortured my mind  
With the pain that someday you'd go  
  
I multiply all of the hours you've been gone  
Still, I can't cry  
Lonely am I  
Why can't I cry?

Guaranteed to blow your mind  
Early one mornin' into mucky swamp dew  
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes  
Though she'll never return all the Cajuns knew  
A witch queen never dies  
  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She'll put a spell on you  
Marie, Marie, La, Voo doo Yeady  
She's the witch queen oh  
Of New Orleans, of New Orleans

648,Tom Jones,Without Love,"I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair  
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah  
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
Without love I've had nothing  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
I have conquered the world  
All but one thing did I have  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me  
There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no  
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see  
That a heart without love cannot live  
Without love I've had nothing  
Without love I've had nothing at all  
I have conquered the world  
All but one thing did I have  
Without love I've had nothing at all

"
649,Tom Jones,Yesterday,"Yesterday  
All my trouble seemed so far away  
Now it looks as though they're here to stay  
Oh, I believe in yesterday  
  
Suddenly  
I'm not half the man I used to be  
There's a shadow hanging over me  
Oh, yesterday came suddenly  
  
Why she had to go I don't know  
She wouldn't say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
  
Yesterday  
Love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh, I believe in yesterday  
  
Why she had to go  
  
Yesterday  
Love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh, I believe in yesterday

651,Tom Jones,You Need Love Like I Do,"Well, well, well, seems like you pulls only yesterday  
When mama told me, don't fall in love with the first girl that comes your way  
She was pretty and nice and I took her fast and passed her by  
Years have passed and moved like love's gonna give me a second try  
More than loved than you first tells me you understand  
Could it be your love life like mine, I need a girlfriend's hand  
Well, you need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(take it girl) I know it ain't fine and proper for a girl to talk this way  
But I can't cope with this loneliness not one more damned on day  
Everyday bringing up your clown to keeping my hopes of love  
Judging from your silence, boy you must be in the same boat  
Well, you need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
I can't begin to tell the many nights I set down lonely  
Come on, tell me girl, has it ever happened to you  
I'm gonna tell you something and believe me, it ain't no joke  
My love life is just like a sinking boat  
I can understand a person beeing without money  
You can show me the reason for a person to be without luck  
Listen to me now, I'm a girl and you're a guy (yes it's true)  
Come on naked and love and try (haha, yeah)  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
Finding true love is a dream everybody wants to come true  
Can't you see it's up to us to make this dream come true  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(Well, well) You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
Ain't it true, ain't it true, ain't it true  
Ain't it true, ain't it true, yes it's so true  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well  
You need love too  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
(Hey, hey) You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you  
You need love like I do, don't you  
It seems like I'm looking in the mirrow, when I'm looking at you  
Ain't it true girl  
Well, I'm in love  
I need love  
And I need you  
And I need you toooo.....au

652,Tom Jones,You're My World,"You're my world--you're every breath I take  
You're my world--you're every move I make  
Other eyes see the stars up in the sky  
But for me they shine within your eyes  
  
As the trees reach for the sun above  
So my arms reach out to you for love  
With your hand resting in mine  
I feel a power so divine  
  
You're my world--you are my night and day  
You're my world--you're every prayer I pray  
If our love ceases to be  
That is the end of my world for me  
  
With your hand resting in mine  
I feel a power so divine  
  
You're my world--you are my night and day  
You're my world--you're every prayer I pray  
If our love ceases to be  
That is the end of my world for me  
End of my world  
End of my world  
End of my world for me

"
653,Tom Jones,You've Got A Friend,"When you're down and troubled  
And you need a helping hand  
And nothing, nothing is going right  
Close your eyes and think of me  
And soon I will be there  
To brighten up even your darkest night  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
I'll come running to see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there  
You've got a friend  
  
If the sky above you  
Grows dark and full of clouds  
And that old north wind begins to blow  
Keep you head together  
And call my name out loud  
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
I'll come running to see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there  
  
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend  
When people can be so cold  
They'll hurt you, and desert you  
And take your soul if you let them  
  
You just call out my name  
And you know wherever I am  
I'll come running to see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there  
You've got a friend  
You've got a friend  
  
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend  
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
