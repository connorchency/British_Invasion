0,Culture Club,Black Comedy,"Sweet cunning eyes try to take from me  
You're too young, I'm too wise, this is parody  
A taste of what you like can be fatal sometimes  
Arms that hold you tight but leave you cold, so cold  
  
The stars in the sky are out of reach tonight  
Tears fall like rain, wrong again, words won't make me right  
'Cause I knew from the start you were wrong for me  
Call it fate if you like or black comedy  
  
Love, maybe lust, made me sweet sixteen  
So my soul lost control, nothing in between  
A taste of what you want can be brutal sometimes  
Arms that hold you tight but leave you cold, so cold  
  
The stars in the sky are out of reach tonight  
Tears fall like rain, wrong again, words won't make me right  
'Cause I knew from the start you were wrong for me  
Call it fate if you like or black comedy  
  
The stars in the sky are out of reach tonight  
Tears fall like rain, wrong again, words won't make me right  
'Cause I knew from the start you were wrong for me  
Call it fate if you like or black comedy  
  
The stars in the sky are out of reach tonight  
Tears fall like rain, wrong again, words won't make me right  
'Cause I knew from the start you were wrong for me  
Call it fate if you like or black comedy  
  
The stars in the sky are out of reach tonight  
Tears fall like rain, wrong again, words won't make me right  
'Cause I knew from the start you were wrong for me  
Call it fate if you like or black comedy

1,Culture Club,Boy Boy (I'm The Boy),"Words that pull the trigger  
Fear the laughing sound  
Haunts you  
To consider  
Love might turn you around  
To face a blind emotion  
Words like 'hey let's try'  
Words like 'thinking it over'  
They just don't apply  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm the boy (you made me)  
I'm the boy  
I'm the boy  
I'm the boy (you made me)  
I'm the boy  
I'm the boy  
  
Love is...  
What you make it  
Love the overflow  
Play if you can take it some...  
They just don't know  
If all the rules they're making  
Break somebody's heart  
What's the use in taking  
Baby's fall apart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You made me realize  
That love is just a word  
That goes unheard in a situation  
Where love is nothing  
And you...  
Are all I can see  
  
This boy's in love with you  
You're everything  
I can see  
This boy's in love with you  
You have taken it all  
Away from me

"
2,Culture Club,Cold Shoulder,"Watching the stars on Primrose Hill  
The moon is high and the city is still  
I came here to escape the chill  
Of your cold shoulder  
  
Evil sometimes the things you say  
If you really wish I would just go away  
Then why do you cry  
Like a little child  
  
All your world that's what you say I am  
I'm working so hard to be a better man  
You know I'll never ever lie, never play those games with my mind  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold, so cold inside  
Remember that fight in Amsterdam  
When I made you cry 'cause I know I can?  
  
You could not escape the chill  
Of my cold, cold shoulder  
All your world that's what you say I am  
I'm working so hard to be a better man  
  
You know I'll never ever lie, never play those games with my mind  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold  
  
I know you're hurting inside  
Want someone to pay for the tears you cry  
Ain't gonna be me, not this time  
Never lie, never play those games with my mind  
  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold, so cold inside  
Never play those games with my mind  
  
You'll be the loser, you might find  
Questions lead to answers in time  
While you're so cold, so cold inside  
I know you're hurting  
  
I'm hurting too  
But I don't want to hurt you  
'Cause I love you  
But my head says 'not this time'

3,Culture Club,Confidence Trick,"Never meant to hurt you, I don't know why  
You come with your lawyers and your alibi  
How can you look me straight in the eye  
When you know  
  
The clock on the wall is singing our song  
The love in my heart is all dead and gone  
You know why  
You know why  
  
There you go with your confidence trick  
I'm much too wise, you don't fool me a bit  
Feeling so low and looking so high  
We both know that your truth is a lie  
  
I never really knew you all these years  
You lied to my face while I undressed your fears  
Then you set me a-sail on an ocean of tears  
Said goodbye  
  
The clock on the wall is ticking real slow  
There's nothing to say and there's nowhere to go  
You know why  
You know why  
  
There, there you go with your confidence trick  
I'm much too wise, you don't fool me a bit, no no  
Feeling so low and looking so high  
We both know that your truth is a lie  
  
It's a lie  
  
Looking up to the truth of what you are  
Blinding all colours and beauty  
And the sparkle in your eye is blinding  
  
The clock on the wall is singing our song  
The love in my heart is all dead and gone  
You know why  
You know why  
Why, why, why, why, why, why  
  
There, there you go with your confidence trick  
I'm much too wise, you don't fool me a bit  
Feeling so low and looking so high  
We both know that your truth is a lie  
It's a lie, lie  
  
[Repeats]  
(The truth is, the truth is a lie)  
  
And you never stopped loving me  
Choking back tears for you  
So lovable  
And we never go  
And we never know  
See I'm over  
But I'm under  
I don't ever wanna come down  
I don't ever wanna come down  
I don't ever wanna come down  
To where you are

4,Culture Club,Dangerous Man,"He could word it out like a dangerous man  
How could you value his intentions?  
Martin had the devil just like anyone can  
He spoke words they were frightened to mention  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yesterday ain't gone  
We just pushed it aside  
Out in the jungle  
There ain't nowhere you can hide  
There's a different smile on your face today  
Though you wear it well there's a lot to say  
There's a different mood in the world tonight  
If we can do it good we can do it right  
  
John he washed it over with a confidence tan  
I know peace and love ain't prevention  
Brian in the closet with his master-plan  
Build them up its so sad they forget you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Are we not men, did you save us?  
Are we not men, did you try, did you try?  
  
We have been [Repeat: x3]  
We have been denied  
  
I could word it out like a dangerous man  
If they landed here we'd collect them  
Yellow, black or white here in the circus of man  
I don't know, I don't care, I forget you  
  
[Chorus]

"
5,Culture Club,Don't Cry,"You say that you're misunderstood  
But you like it that way  
Then you say you're lonely  
Well that's the price you pay  
And I don't think I love you  
That's the cruelest game we play  
But I love you that way  
You're a perfect lover  
Why don't you stay?  
You're a perfect lover  
Ain't it always that way  
You feel a little twisted  
You feel a little pain  
You're a little hateful  
Don't worry, you'll feel that way again  
Cry, don't  
Cry don't cry for me  
You say that you're not beautiful  
But you are in my eyes  
You say my love's too heavy  
Well that comes as no surprise  
It's already over  
There's nothing to say  
It's already over  
But you need to love to show you your way

"
6,Culture Club,Don't Go Down That Street,"Don't go down that street  
In those shoes that squeak  
'cause I get afraid that you might not come home  
Careful how you speak  
When you're on the street  
'cause they've broken down all the telephones  
  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street  
  
Don't go down that street  
Where the brave boys meet  
'cause I'm chicken feed when they're on their own  
Don't get in that car  
Things might go too far  
(line in japanese)  
  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street, no no no  
Don't go down that street

7,Culture Club,Fat Cat,"Another song of woe  
Woe sounds like this  
You say nothing's changed, where were you when my world  
Was spinning into masquerade  
You claim it's just a question of mathematics  
I shut the door on your amateur dramatics  
Then you think too much  
And you talk too much, vicariously  
Yeah you think too much  
And you talk too much  
Every word is substance free  
You're the dirt on my collar  
You're the hole in my favourite shoe  
You're the last dying breath of love  
You're the weight that I need to lose  
And you hurt yourself  
You say I'm deranged, I'll admit to being strange  
But I just can't stop loving you  
If the light in your eyes  
Addiction came as a surprise  
Didn't think I'd be so into you  
Then you think too much  
And you talk too much, so carelessly  
Yeah you think too much  
And you talk too much  
Every word is substance free  
You're the dirt on my collar  
You're the hole in my favourite shoe  
You're the last dying breath of love  
You're the weight that I need to lose  
You're the dirt on my collar  
You're the hole in my favourite shoe  
You're the last, last dying breath of love  
You're the weight that I need to lose  
You're the dirt on my collar  
You're the hole in my favourite shoe  
You're the last dying breath of love  
You're the weight that I need to lose

8,Culture Club,How D'ya Keep Your Credibility?,"Hey, this song is for Marilyn and every drag queen  
Oh brother, it's not like the past  
We're wearing stilettos and talking too fast  
Passing the mirror hung up in pose  
The boys they were fairest in immaculate clothes  
Lunch with Janet Street Porter and Marilyn's nose  
But this life is a baby, so sad when it grows  
Into you and me, ah, what the hell we're gonna be?  
Where will we go and what will we be?  
If we can't communicate intelligently  
There's a price on my head but I've never been free  
I said, ""'How d'ya keep your credibility?""  
No more crying, no more trying  
Please, no more dying  
I just wanna be free  
I'm taking the trouble right to your door  
Why'd you do it, you bastard? Don't love you no more  
Sinners beside me, saints on the right  
And if you slow down, you'll be a turkey tonight  
c'mon let's go a little further, don't be uptight  
If you feel insecure, well, just turn off the light  
Where will we go and what will we be?  
If we can't communicate intelligently  
There's a price on my head but I've never been free  
I said, ""'How d'ya keep your credibility?""  
I said, ""'How d'ya keep your credibility?""

9,Culture Club,Less Than Perfect,"I know a song ain't good enough to let you know how I feel  
I'll sing it hard, I'll sing it sweet, to let you know that it's real  
If I change my attitude, maybe I can conquer you completely  
All the things I say and do, everything I learn from you defeats me  
  
And I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
  
I know it's wrong to blame the past for everything that I do  
I fool the world most of the time but there's no fooling you  
If I change my attitude, maybe I can conquer you completely  
Everything I say and do, all I learn from you defeat me  
  
And I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
I let you down  
Let you down  
  
What you see ain't always what you get  
No matter how clear it seems  
One minute lovers, then the next  
  
Oh oh no  
Oh no  
  
I let you down, yeah yeah  
I let you down [Repeat: x5]  
Let you down  
Let you down

10,Culture Club,Love Hurts,"Not everybody knows which way the river flows  
Not everybody sees the sun up in the sky

If only what we could see what we hold in our hands  
  
Love hurts 'cause you can't let it go  
Love hurts 'cause you need it so  
Love hurts yes it hurts, but it's good for fools

11,Culture Club,Next 2 You (Demo),"It doesn't matter if I say you're right even when you're wrong

When I need to survive

But only for things that never were mine

And don't let them fool you  
That this love can't go on

Eyes like a deep blue sea

On loving, living  
Out and in the enemy

The passion that our hearts conceal  
Kiss and run  
The fools we trust  
Love inside a blinding lust

20,Def Leppard,Another Hit And Run,"Union Jack is back with a hole in his head  
He's gettin' badly burned every time  
He's laughin' at me and dancin' on my sneakers  
And his sixties songs are blowin' up my speakers  
  
I say you got no respect  
Respect for authority  
You're just playing your dirty tricks  
And then come cryin' to me

21,Def Leppard,Blood Runs Cold,"I heard this line one time 'bout tryin' to save the world  
But have you ever tried to save yourself  
A wide-eyed suicide drive  
Remains a fake  
As if you'd ever  
Ever go and make the same mistake  
Strung out as the night comes crawlin'  
Your halo of thorns is fallin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Blood runs cold  
I feel it in my bones  
But you don't know your time is up  
Blood runs cold  
  
Somebody somewhere is screamin' out the words  
But do they ever really ease the pain  
I guess what I'm trying to say  
Is whose life is it anyway because livin'  
Living is the best revenge  
You can play  
This fall from grace  
I see your face  
It's over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From you love was kind  
Resolved left scarred and blind  
Wasted and naked in the wings  
  
Denying twist of fate  
Demanding Heaven's gate  
Lying in wait above the wind  
  
Strung out as the night comes crawlin'  
Your halo of thorns is fallin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blood runs cold  
Blood runs cold

Sad mascaraed  
  
Wrap your arms around me like a wire  
You reach into my soul pull out the fire

When I come undone I know you're the only one  
Who can touch me when I call out your name  
When I come undone I know you're the only one  
Who can put me back together again  
  
You've got what it takes to make me  
So won't you come and shake me out of this haze  
All to know those dreams you're sellin'  
God knows, man, he's not tellin'  
He's had better days...  
  
Awaitin' here your voice above me callin'  
You dragged me to my knees, but I'm still fallin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't close my ayes  
Can't hide the tear  
I feel the earth beneath my feet disappear  
I'm out of words, I'm out of time  
Give me your hand  
Reach out for mine  
  
Wrap your arms around me like a wire  
You reach into my soul pull out the fire

23,Def Leppard,Desert Song,"Dark and dirty  
Like you have never seen  
A mind so twisted  
With thoughts so unclean.  
My heart is racing  
All tattered and torn  
I stand here naked  
As the day I was born.  
  
Over and over I stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand  
I got to believe  
  
The sky is falling  
On this setting son  
Echoes of silence  
Ringing loud and long  
This isolation  
Is the king of pain  
A lost horizon  
In an ocean of flames  
  
Only the lonely will stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand  
I got to believe  
  
I've been here before,  
But not as I stand here today  
I wait for the dawn  
Ready to walk  
Into the light

24,Def Leppard,Fractured Love,"I'm caught in a dream  
Sometimes it ain't what it seems  
I'm all in a daze  
Can't find my way out of this maze  
I'm looking for clues  
And wanting a change in the rules  
I'm locked in a cage  
Acting out on the wrong stage  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
I'm caught in a dream  
  
I'm stood at the edge and I'm looking down  
Caught in the danger zone  
I feel like a king that has lost his crown  
And now I stand here alone  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't need the third degree  
Just got to break away and scream  
I'm caught in a dream!!!  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
I don't care if you pull down the sky  
Angry passion is a friend of mine  
Reach out for the sky above  
It's just a fractured love  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
Why don't you set me free!  
  
Don't want your sympathy  
Don't want your third degree  
Just got to break  
Break away and scream!  
  
I'm caught in a dream  
Why don't you set me free  
  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Iron fist in a velvet glove  
Fractured love, fractured love  
Cracks in the mirror of this fractured love  
  
Don't give me your fractured love!

37,Def Leppard,Pearl Of Euphoria,"Your price, name the time  
The suspect or the crime  
The shadow of my gun  
Get down or you can run  
  
Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire  
Empty room, turn the key  
You're never alone  
When you're with me  
  
Temptation, break the vow  
Cut flesh from the sacred cow  
Unchain the tiger, kiss the flame, feel your desire  
Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire  
  
Soaked in fear, the curtain falls  
Religion within these walls  
Mystify my soul beliefs  
Confession is my release  
  
Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire  
Unchain the tiger, crucify, feed your desire  
Pearl of euphoria

But the good life's never won by degrees, no  
Pointless passing through Harvard or Yale

You may be stranded if you stick around

Clock strikes three and it's time to be the hero  
D'you want to be a Blade, it's a feeling that you'll never know  
  
You've got to fight it tooth and nail  
Out here on this Battlefield  
  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart on your sleeve  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
The winner takes it all  
So don't let me down, don't you let me down  
  
The magic and the mystery  
Out here on this field of dreams  
  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart on your sleeve  
When Saturday comes  
Nothing else matters to me  
When Saturday comes  
You got to wear your heart  
You got to wear your heart

When you come down here  
You're already on your knees  
You want to ride White Lightnin'  
Then sign your name  
If you want to dance with the devil  
You gotta play his way, play the game  
You gotta taste that sweetness  
Cause you can't say no  
But are you ready for the nightmare  
When you can't let go  
Like a soldier of fortune  
When the money runs dry  
You got rivers of bitter tears, in your eyes  
  
You want to leave but you can't let go  
You want to stop but you can't say no  
You'll never laugh about it  
You just can't live without it  
You had enough but you just want more  
You never get what you're lookin' for  
You'll never laugh about it, never  
  
You got both ends burning  
You're like a moth to a flame  
You're going off the rails  
Like a runaway train  
It's a no-win situation  
And there's no way out  
And no one will ever hear you, scream and shout  
  
You want to leave but you can't let go  
You want to stop but you can't say no  
You'll never laugh about it  
You just can't live without it  
You had enough but you just want more  
You never get what you're lookin' for  
You'll never laugh about it, never

56,Def Leppard,Worlds Collide,"Released on the cd-single for ""promises""  
  
Never gonna die now  
Crawling from a wrecked jam, I'm laughing out loud  
Angel on my shoulder  
Living at the speed of sound  
Heavenly distraction  
I'm hanging on the edge and spinning out of control  
Choose your medication  
It's a generation overload  
  
I can see it falling from the sky  
Can you feel me  
I can hear you calling when you cry  
Can you see me  
Pain and suffering, your knees are tied  
Will you hear me  
Everchanging as your worlds collide  
  
Running going nowhere  
Take it to the limit then it's payback time  
Nothing but a heartache  
Waiting at the end of the line  
Take a look around, babe  
You're looking down the barrel of a loaded mind  
Generation landslide  
Crawling through the enemy lines  
  
I will be the one your justify  
Will you hear me  
I will kiss you with a last goodbye  
  
I thought I was the one who could survive  
Does anyone get outta here alive  
I gotta find the courage, gotta make a change  
And start all over again  
Taken for a ride against my will  
And taking it is always such a bitter pill  
Shaken for the sake of it, no more  
Gotta get away cause I don't know what I'm doing it for  
  
I can see it falling from the sky  
Can you feel me  
I can hear you calling when you cry  
Can you see me  
I will be there when you close your eyes  
Will you hear me  
Everchanging as your worlds collide

This must be someone else's story  
I can't follow what you've planned  
How could this be about me  
Am I supposed to understand?

Heading out to sea  
You can hardly see it now

Still can't find a trace  
If there is nothing after  
There 'll be the saving grace

I need some kind of sign  
Can't take away the sorrow now  
I gave you all that's mine

Tear it into pieces  
All of the boys and the girls  
Will see how easy it is

To put it all down and start again  
From the top to the bottom, and then  
I'll have faith, or I prefer  
To think that things couldn't turn out worse  
  
All that we need at the start's  
Universal revolution (that's all)  
And if we trust in our hearts  
We'll find the solution's

Took a plane across the world  
Got in a car  
And when I reached my destination  
I hadn't gone far

The mountains and the sand  
Let all the boys and the girls  
Shape it in their hands

61,Depeche Mode,Any Second Now,"She remembered all the shadows and the doubts  
The same film  
  
Vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty  
And the night so still  
  
Such a small affair, a relapse  
Someone closing like the nightclub door  
  
Here again and when you speak  
I watch you move away  
And seem so sure  
  
She is hoping to forget  
And the moment almost slips away  
  
When the colours move apart  
And I wonder if you want to stay  
  
And I need to change you  
Like the words I'm reading  
Don't you understand  
  
This the warning and the message  
I remember as you touch my hand

62,Depeche Mode,Barrel Of A Gun,"Do you mean this horny creep  
Set upon weary feet  
Who looks in need of sleep  
That doesn't come  
This twisted, tortured mess  
This bed of sinfulness  
Who's longing for some rest  
And feeling numb  
What do you expect of me  
What is it you want?  
Whatever you've planned for me  
I'm not the one  
A vicious appetite  
Visits me each night  
And won't be satisfied  
Won't be denied  
An unbearable pain  
A beating in my brain  
That leaves the mark of Cain  
Right here inside  
What am I supposed to do?  
When everything that I've done  
Is leading me to conclude  
I'm not the one  
Whatever I've done  
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun  
Is there something you need from me?  
Are you having your fun?  
I never agreed to be  
Your Holy One  
Whatever I've done  
I've been staring down the Barrel of a Gun

There are times when I feel  
I rather not be  
The one behind the wheel  
Come  
Pull my strings  
Watch me move  
I do anything  
Please  
Sweet little girl  
I prefer

Do what you want  
I'm going cheap

Where my holiness goes  
I just know that I like  
What is starting to show

An end to the tears  
And the in-between years  
And the troubles I've seen  
Now that I'm clean  
You know what I mean  
I've broken my fall  
Put an end to it all  
I've changed my routine  
Now I'm clean  
As years go by  
All the feelings inside  
Twist and they turn  
As they ride with the tide  
I don't advise  
And I don't criticise  
I just know what I like  
With my own eyes  
Sometimes  
Clean  
The cleanest I've been  
An end to the tears  
And the in-between years  
And the troubles I've seen  
Now that I'm clean  
You know what I mean

If for kindness

Please open your eyes  
Condemnation

Because my duty  
Was always to beauty  
And that was my crime  
Feel elation  
High  
To know I can trust this  
Fix of injustice  
Time after time

As immaturity  
Well it's no surprise  
If for kindness  
You substitute blindness  
Please open your eyes

Drawn together  
By subtleties that we are not aware of

The world makes sense  
There is no pretense  
And you're crying  
When you're by my side  
There is no defense  
I forget to sense I'm dying  
  
We're damaged people  
Praying for something  
That doesn't come from somewhere deep inside us  
Depraved souls  
Trusting in the one thing  
The one thing that this life has not denied us  
  
When I feel the warmth of your very soul  
I forget I'm cold  
And crying  
When your lips touch mine  
And I lose control  
I forget I'm old  
And dying

Dancing with a distant friend  
  
Filming and screening  
I picture the scene  
Filming and dreaming  
Dreaming of me  
  
So we left  
Understanding  
Clean cut so we're sounding fast  
Talked of sad  
I talked of war  
I laughed and climbed the rising cast  
  
Quickly I remembered  
Fused and saw a face before  
Timing reason  
Understanding  
Like association hall

The holiday  
Was fun packed  
The contract  
Still intact  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
All for themselves  
After all  
It's a competitive world  
Everything counts in large amounts  
The graph  
On the wall  
Tells the story  
Of it all  
Picture it now  
See just how  
The lies and deceit  
Gained a little more power  
Confidence  
Taken in  
By a sun tan  
And a grin  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
All for themselves

Grab all they can  
Everything counts in large amounts

Here comes that time again when  
You'll walk right out the door  
Don't tell me secrets anymore  
  
And fools don't run away  
You'll be followed another day  
And all the chances that fall your way  
Are in the fire on your dying day  
So call me now and tell me that you're home  
  
Can't see the sense in crying  
There's too many tears to fall

So I'll try to save them all

74,Depeche Mode,Fragile Tension,"Well it's a fragile tension,  
That's keeping us going.  
It may not last forever,  
But oh, when it's flowing.  
  
There's something magical in the air.  
Some things so tragic we have to care.  
  
It's a strange obsession,  
That's's drawing us nearer.  
We don't understand it,  
It never gets clearer.  
  
There's something mystical in our genes.  
So simplistic it kicks and screams.  
  
Oh when we're teetering  
On the edge of the collapse,  
Nothing can keep us down.  
  
It's a dizzying feeling  
That's keeping us flying.  
Some glittering galas,  
Without even trying.  
  
There's something radical in our hands.  
Nothing logical to our plans.

Yearning for a liberation  
Emotional emancipation

Flow between our lips  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Flow between our hips  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Why do you smile the smile you do  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Pass between our eyes  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Pass between our thighs  
  
And I would have to pinch her  
Just to see if she was real  
Just to watch the smile fade away  
And see the pain she'd feel  
  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Feel it deep within  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Penetrate my skin  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Why do you smile the smile you do  

"
78,Depeche Mode,Heaven,"Sometimes I slide away  
Silently  
I slowly lose myself  
Over and over  
  
Take comfort in my skin  
Endlessly  
Surrender to my will  
Forever and ever  
  
I dissolve in trust  
I will sing with joy  
I will end up dust  
I'm in heaven  
  
I stand in golden rays  
Radiantly  
I burn a fire of love  
Over and over  
  
Reflecting endless light  
Relentlessly  
I have embraced the flame  
Forever and ever  
  
I will scream The Word  
Jump into the void  
I will guide the world  
Up to heaven

"
79,Depeche Mode,Higher Love,"I can taste more than feel  
This burning inside is so real  
I can almost lay my hands upon  
The warm glow that lingers on  
Moved, lifted higher  
Moved, my soul's on fire  
Moved, by a higher love  
I surrender all control  
To the desire that consumes me whole  
Leads me by the hand to infinity  
Lies in wait at the heart of me  
Moved, lifted higher  
Moved, my soul's on fire  
Moved, by a higher love  
Heaven bound on the wings of love  
There's so much that you can rise above  
Moved, lifted higher  
Moved, moved, by a higher love  
By a higher love  
I surrender heart and soul  
Sacrificed to a higher goal  
Moved, moved by a higher love  
By a higher love  

"
80,Depeche Mode,Home,"Here is a song from the wrong side of town  
Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound  
And it pounds from within and is pinning me down  
Here is a page from the emptiest stage  
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made  
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong here  
The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets  
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet  
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong  
Feels like home  
I should have known  
From my first breath  
God send the only true friend I call mine  
Pretend that I'll make amends the next time  
Befriend the glorious end of the line  
And I thank you for bringing me here  
For showing me home  
For singing these tears  
Finally I've found that I belong here  

"
81,Depeche Mode,I Feel You,"I feel you, your sun, it shines.  
I feel you within my mind.  
You take me there, you take me where the kingdom comes.  
You take me to, and lead me through Babylon.  
  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.  
  
I feel you, your heart, it sings.  
I feel you, the joy it brings.  
Where heaven waits, those golden gates, and back again.  
You take me to, you lead me through oblivion.  
  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.  
I feel you, your precious soul, and I am whole.  
I feel you, your rising sun, my kingdom comes.  
  
I feel you, each move you make.  
I feel you, each breath you take.  
Where angels sing and spread their wings my love's on high.  
You take me home to glory's throne by and by.  
  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.  
This is the morning of our love.  
It's just the dawning of our love.

82,Depeche Mode,I Like It,"I like it, I like it  
I like the way you run your fingers through my hair  
And I love the way you tickle my chin  
And I like the way you let yourself in when your mommy's not there  
I like it, I like it  
I like the things you say and all the things you do  
And I like the way you straighten my tie  
And I like the way you're winking your eye  
And I know I like you  
And I know I like you  
  
Do that again  
You're driving me insane  
Kiss me once more  
That's another thing I like you for  
I like it, I like it  
I like the funny feelings when I'm with you  
And I like you more with every day  
And I like to always hearing you say you're liking it too  
You're liking it too  
  
Do that again  
You're driving me insane  
Kiss me once more  
That's another thing I like you for  
  
I like it, I like it  
I like the funny feelings when I'm with you  
With every day

83,Depeche Mode,I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead,"New sound all around  
You can hear it too  
Getting hot, never stop  
Just for me and you  
Playing on my radio and saying that you had to go  
  
New day turn away  
Wipe away the tear  
New night, feel right  
Knowing that you're here  
Dancing with you all the time, and don't you think that it's a crime  
  
Back street never meet  
Never say goodbye  
I know where you go  
But I don't know why  
You say that it's from above, and I say this is modern love

"
84,Depeche Mode,I Want It All,"I see a river  
It's oceans that I want  
You have to give me everything  
But everything's not enough  
  
It's my desire  
To give myself to you  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I try  
Sometimes I lie with you  
Sometimes I cry  
Sometimes I die it's true  
Somewhere I find something that's kind in you  
  
And I've crossed the line again  
A line I drew in sand  
And still you give me everything  
But everything's not enough  
  
I'm ready but not willing  
To give myself to you  
Sometimes  
  
Come on over lay down beside me  
And I'll try  
Come on over lay down beside me  
And I'll try  
And I'll try  
  
I want it all

"
85,Depeche Mode,If You Want,"Working week's come to its end  
Party time is here again  
Everyone can come if they want to  
If you want to be with me  
If you want to be with me  
You can come with me if you want to  
  
Exercise your basic right  
We could build a building site  
From the bricks of shame is built the hope  
If you want to be with me  
If you want to be with me  
Even though you may still not want to  
  
Let tomorrow and today  
Bring a life of ecstasy  
Wipe away your tears of confusion  
If you want to be with me  
If you want to be with me  
You can come with me if you want to  
Even though you still may not want to

"
86,Depeche Mode,In Sympathy,"They're almost falling over you  
Why don't they call a truce  
What ever they are trying to do  
It's of little use  
They're drowning you in compliments  
Trying to furnish proof  
And though they speak with eloquence  
There is little truth  
  
[Chorus]  
You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong  
At least to some degree  
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough  
You smile in sympathy  
  
I'm watching your serenity  
The way your soul transcends  
Their tedious obscenities  
You're patience never ends  
  
And as the night begins to fade  
You are heading for the door  
Followed by a sad parade  
You're on your own once more  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
You're bright, you're strong, you know your right from wrong  
At least to some degree  
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough  
You smile in sympathy

"
87,Depeche Mode,Insight,"This is an insight  
Into my life  
This is a strange flight  
I'm taking  
My true will  
Carries me along  
  
This is a soul dance  
Embracing me  
This is the first chance  
To put things right  
Moving on  
Guided by the light  
  
And the spirit of love  
Is rising within me  
Talking to you now  
Telling you clearly  
The fire still burns  
  
Wisdom of ages  
Rush over me  
Heighten my senses  
Enlighten me  
Lead me on  
Eternally  
  
And the spirit of love  
Is rising within me  
Talking to you now  
Telling you clearly  
The fire still burns  
  
I'm talking to you now  
The fire still burns  
Whatever you do now  
The world still turns

88,Depeche Mode,It Doesn't Matter,"I am happy  
That I have you  
Even though you're not here now  
I know somewhere  
You are dreaming  
Though it's definitely not of me  
  
It doesn't matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But I'm praying  
That we're staying  
Together  
  
I am warmed by  
Your friendship  
Even when you're far away  
And I'm happy  
In the knowledge  
We may never see the day  
  
When I kiss you  
And you kiss me  
Don't pretend you miss me  
The worst kind  
Of diseased mind  
Is one filled with jealousy  
  
If we should meet again  
Don't try to solve the puzzle  
Just lay down next to me  
And please don't move a muscle  
  
I will thank you  
Most of all for  
The respect you have for me  
I'm embarrassed  
It overwhelms me  
Because I don't deserve any  
  
It doesn't matter  
If this all shatters  
Nothing lasts forever  
But I'm praying  
That we're staying  
Together

"
89,Depeche Mode,It's Called A Heart,"There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you, would you keep it safe for me  
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
There's a sun shining in the sky  
But that's not the reason why I'm feeling warm inside  
The answer isn't classified- it's my heart  
From the moment I started  
I tried to be good about it  
Yes I've tried my best  
And more or less, I spoke from my heart  
There's a lot to be learned  
And you learn when your heart gets burned  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you, would you keep it safe for me  
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
Hearts can never be owned  
Hearts only come on loan  
If I want it back  
I will take it back  
I'll take my heart  
But I will try my best  
And more or less  
I will speak from my heart  
Yes, I will speak from my heart  
Speak from my heart  
There's a lot to be learned  
And you learn when your heart gets burned  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart  
You know how easy it is to tear it apart  
If I lend it to you, would you keep it safe for me  
I'll lend it to you, will you treat it tenderly  
There's something beating here inside my body  
And it's called a heart

90,Depeche Mode,Jezebel,"They call you Jezebel  
Whenever we walk in  
You're going straight to hell  
For wanted acts of sin - they say,  
And that I'll have to pay  
But I need you just this way  
  
They call you Jezebel  
For what you like to wear  
You're morally unwell  
They say you never care for me  
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key  
  
Open their eyes to the beauty  
Open their hearts to the fun  
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone  
  
They call you Jezebel  
Whenever men walk by  
They say that they can tell  
The longing in your eyes is real  
And how you really feel  
But they can't see your appeal  
  
Jezebel

91,Depeche Mode,John The Revelator,"John the Revelator  
Put him in a elevator  
Take him up to the highest high  
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop  
Let him tell his book of lies  
  
John the Revelator  
He's a smooth operator  
It's time we cut him down to size  
Take him by the hand  
And put him on the stand  
Let us hear his alibis  
  
By claiming God as his only rock  
He's stealing a god from the Israelite  
Stealing a god from a Muslim, too  
There is only one god through and through  
  
Seven lies, multiplied by seven, multiplied by seven again  
Seven angels with seven trumpets  
Send them home on the morning train  
Well who's that shouting?  
John the Revelator!  
All he ever gives us is pain  
Well who's that shouting?  
John the Revelator!  
He should bow his head in shame  
  
Bye-bye  
Bye-bye  
Bye-bye  
Bye-bye

92,Depeche Mode,Little 15,"Little fifteen  
You help her forget  
The world outside  
You're not part of it yet  
And if you could drive  
You could drive her away  
To a happier place  
To a happier day  
That exists in your mind  
And in your smile  
She could escape there  
Just for a while  
Little fifteen  
Little fifteen  
Why take the smooth with the rough  
When things run smooth  
It's already more than enough  
She knows your mind  
Is not yet in league  
With the rest of the world  
And its little intrigues  
Do you understand  
Do you know what she means  
As time goes by  
And when you've seen what she's seen  
you will  
Little fifteen  
Little fifteen  
Why does she have to defend  
Her feelings inside  
Why pretend  
She's not had a life  
A life of near misses  
Now all that she wants  
Is three little wishes  
She wants to see with your eyes  
She wants to smile with your smile  
She wants a nice surprise  
Every once in a while  
She wants to see with your eyes  
She wants to smile with your smile  
She wants a nice surprise  
Every once in a while

93,Depeche Mode,More Than A Party,"Lots of surprises in store  
This isn't a party  
It's a whole lot more  
  
We've had enough of this blind man's bluff  
You've kept us in the dark for long enough  
  
This is more than a party  
More than a party  
More than a party  
  
Keep telling us we're to have fun  
Then take all the ice cream so we've got none  
  
The failed magician waves his wand  
And in an instant the laughter's gone  
  
Loads of surprises in store  
This isn't a party  
It's a whole lot more

94,Depeche Mode,Never Turn Your Back On Mother Earth (Bong Magazine),"When she's on her best behaiviour  
Don't be tempted by her favours  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
Towns are hurled from A to B  
By hands that looked so smooth to me  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
Grasp at straws that don't want grasping  
Gaze at clouds that come down crashing  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
Three days and two nights away from my friends  
Amen to anything that brings a quick return  
To my friends  
To my friends  
Never turn your back on mother earth  
I'll admit I was unfaithful  
But from now I'll be more faithful  
Never turn your back on mother  
Never turn your back on mother  
Never turn your back on mother earth

Opened up my eyes

I've got someone who cares for me  
Someone who believes in me  
I've got someone understanding me  
Someone crying over me  
For all the right reasons

And I pray to the only one  
Who has the strength  
To bear the pain  
To forgive all the things that I've done  
Oh Girl  
Lead me into your darkness  
When this world is trying it's hardest  
To leave me unimpressed  
Just one caress  
From you and I'm blessed  
When you think you've tried every road  
Every avenue  
Take one more look  
At what you found old  
And in it you'll find something new  
I'm shying from the light  
I always loved the night  
And now you offer me eternal darkness  
I have to believe that sin  
Can make a better man  
It's the mood that I am in  
That left us back where we began

98,Depeche Mode,People Are People,"People are people so why should it be  
You and I should get along so awfully  
So we're different colours  
And we're different creeds  
And different people have different needs  
It's obvious you hate me  
Though I've done nothing wrong  
I never even met you  
So what could I have done  
I can't understand  
What makes a man  
Hate another man  
Help me understand  
People are people so why should it be  
You and I should get along so awfully  
Help me understand  
Now you're punching and you're kicking  
And you're shouting at me  
I'm relying on your common decency  
So far it hasn't surfaced  
But I'm sure it exists  
It just takes a while to travel  
From your head to your fist  
I can't understand  
What makes a man  
Hate another man  
Help me understand

But it's my duty  
I'm a missionary  
So here is my confession  
It's an obsession  
I'm a firm believer  
And a warm receiver  
And I've made my decision  
This is religion  
There's no doubt  
I'm one of the devout  
Trying to sell the story  
Of love's eternal glory  
Sacred  
Holy  
To put it in words  
To write it down  
That is walking on hallowed ground  
But it's my duty  
I'm a missionary  
Spreading the news around the world  
Taking the word to boys and girls  
I'm a firm believer  
And a warm receiver  
And I will go down on my knees  
When I see beauty  
There's no doubt  
I'm one of the devout  
Trying to sell the story  
Of love's eternal glory  
Sacred  
Holy  
To put it in words  
To write it down  
That is walking on hallowed ground  
But it's my duty  
I'm a missionary  
Sacred  
Holy  
To put it in words  
To write it down  
That is walking on hallowed ground

105,Depeche Mode,Satellite,"Now hear this my friends  
I'll never be the same again  
Going to lock myself in a cold black room  
Going to shadow myself in a veil of gloom  
I will function, operate  
I will be a satellite of hate  
  
Driven to this point by a chain of events  
Each one pushed me nearer the edge  
Going to send my message through to you  
You'll receive the signal too  
I will function, operate  
I will be a satellite of hate  
  
Higher, Higher  
  
Disillusioned, I was disenchanted  
Forgot the love that had been implanted  
Heard the lies and I felt the cold  
It broke my heart and I lost control  
Now I'm a satellite of a free state  
I'm a satellite of hate

106,Depeche Mode,Sea Of Sin,"Sea of sin  
I'm swimming in  
And I'm taking a dive  
My mind's in need  
So my body feeds  
And it keeps me alive  
It gets better and better  
As it gets wetter and wetter  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
But I don't care  
  
Sea of sin  
Through thick and thin  
For better or worse  
My mind's in need  
So my body feeds  
And it quenches my thirst  
You look cheaper and cheaper  
As we sink deeper and deeper  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
'Cause I've been there  
  
Here under God's sky  
His watchful eye  
And all of the lies  
My consolation prize  
  
Sea of sin  
My second skin  
My home from home  
When I'm in doubt  
My hands reach out  
And I'm never alone  
It gets wetter and wetter  
As it gets better and better  
  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
And I'm prepared  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
Yes I'm aware  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
'Cause I've been there  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
And I don't care  
Sea of sin  
Know where you've been  
And I don't care

107,Depeche Mode,See You,"All I want to do is see you again  
Is that too much to ask for?  
I just want to see your sweet smile  
Smile the way it was before  
Well I'll try not to hold you  
And I'll try not to kiss you  
  
And I won't even touch you  
All I want to do is see you  
Don't you know that it's true  
  
I remember the days when we'd walk through the woods  
And sit on a bench for a while  
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play  
And look in each others eyes  
You can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance  
  
But I swear I won't touch you  
All I want to do is see you  
Don't you know that it's true  
  
Well I know five years is a long time  
And that times change (oh that times change)  
But I think that you will find  
People are basically the same (basically the same)  
If the water's still flowing, we can go for a swim  
And do the things we used to do  
And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in  
And we can relive our youth  
Oh but we'll stay friendly like sister and brother  
  
Though I think I still love you  
All I want to do is see you  
Don't you know that it's true?

To get excited about  
When everything is looking dull  
I'm sure it isn't impossible to  
Set me free  
Remotivate me

Don't think I'm impatient  
Because I'm willing to wait  
But something must must happen  
Before it gets too late  
It could be my imagination  
But wasn't there more than this dull sensation  
Set me free  
Remotivate me

And a dress that's tight  
And come with me  
On a mystery night  
Open your eyes

My angel coming  
In a brilliant white

110,Depeche Mode,Sister Of Night,"Sister of night  
When the hunger descends  
And your body's a fire  
An inferno that never ends  
An eternal flame  
That burns in desire's name  
Sister of night  
When the longing returns  
Giving voice to the flame  
Calling you through flesh that burns  
Breaking down your will  
To move in for the kill  
Oh sister, come for me  
Embrace me, assure me  
Hey sister, I feel it too  
Sweet sister, just feel me  
I'm trembling, you heal me  
Hey sister, I feel it too  
Sister of night  
In your saddest dress  
As you walk through the light  
You're desperate to impress  
So you slide to the floor  
Feeling insecure  
Sister of night  
With the loneliest eyes  
Tell yourself it's alright  
He'll make such a perfect prize  
But the cold light of day  
Will give the game away  
Oh sister, come for me  
Embrace me, assure me  
Hey sister, I feel it too  
Sweet sister, just feel me  
I'm trembling, you heal me  
Hey sister, I feel it too

111,Depeche Mode,Smile In A Crowd (Oriental Mix),"You turned me away  
Away from your actions  
Forced by the violence  
That always surrounds you

A smile in this crowd  
I want your special smile  
A smile in this crowd  
You burnt yourself out  
In that silence  
I have to tell you  
I ache for you still  
The sound of my words  
Is always so shocking  
They get much louder  
Each time I speak  
I want your special smile  
A smile in this crowd  
I want your special smile  
A smile in this crowd  
Signals of progress  
We're growing much older

And my ache never goes

I want your special smile  
A smile in this crowd

112,Depeche Mode,Somebody,"I want somebody to share  
Share the rest of my life  
Share my innermost thoughts  
Know my intimate details  
Someone who'll stand by my side  
And give me support  
And in return  
She'll get my support  
She will listen to me  
When I want to speak  
About the world we live in  
And life in general  
Though my views may be wrong  
They may even be perverted  
She'll hear me out  
And won't easily be converted  
To my way of thinking  
In fact she'll often disagree  
But at the end of it all  
She will understand me  
  
I want somebody who cares  
For me passionately  
With every thought and  
With every breath  
Someone who'll help me see things  
In a different light  
All the things I detest  
I will almost like  
I don't want to be tied  
To anyone's strings  
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of  
Those things  
But when I'm asleep  
I want somebody  
Who will put their arms around me  
And kiss me tenderly  
Though things like this  
Make me sick  
In a case like this  
I'll get away with it

113,Depeche Mode,Something To Do,"My little girl  
Won't you come with me  
Come with me  
And tell me  
Is there something to do  
I'm going crazy with boredom  
Come with me  
Tell me  
Grey sky over a black town  
I can feel depression  
All around  
You've got your leather boots on  
I can't stand another drink  
It's surprising this town  
Doesn't sink  
You've got your leather boots on  
Your pretty dress is oil stained  
From working too hard  
For too little  
You've got your leather boots on  
You're feeling the boredom too  
I'd gladly go with you  
I'd put your leather boots on  
I'd put your pretty dress on

114,Depeche Mode,Song For Europe (Unreleased Track),"Here  
As I sit  
At this empty cafe  
Thinking of you  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
Though the world  
Is my oyster  
It's only a shell  
Full of memories  
Here by the Seine  
Notre-Dame casts  
A long lonely shadow  
Now only sorrow  
No tomorrow  
There's no today for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterday  
This is my song  
This is my song  
This is my song  
These cities may change  
But there always remains  
My obsession  
Through silken waters  
My gondola glides  
And the bridge  
it sighs  
I remember  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
There's no more time for us  
Nothing is there  
For us to share  
But yesterdays  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again  
All those moments  
Lost in wonder  
That we'll never  
Find again

115,Depeche Mode,Stories Of Old,"Take a look at unselected cases  
You'll find love has been wrecked  
By both sides compromising  
Amounting to a disastrous effect  
  
You hear stories of old  
Of princes bold  
With riches untold  
Happy souls  
Casting it all aside  
To take some bride  
To have the girl of their dreams  
At their side  
But not me  
I couldn't do that  
Not me  
I'm not like that  
  
I couldn't sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love  
  
I really like you  
I'm attracted to you  
The way you move  
The things you do  
I'll probably burn in hell  
For saying this  
But I'm really in heaven  
Whenever we kiss  
But Oh no!  
You won't change me  
You can try  
For an eternity  
  
I wouldn't sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love  
  
Now I've got things to do  
You have too  
And I've got to be me  
You've got to be you  
So take my hand  
And feel these lips  
And let's savour a kiss  
Like we'd savour a sip  
Of vintage wine  
One more time  
Let's surrender  
To this love divine  
  
But we won't sacrifice  
Anything at all  
To love

116,Depeche Mode,Suffer Well,"Where were you when I fell from grace  
Frozen heart, an empty space  
Something's changing, it's in your eyes  
Please don't speak, you'll only lie  
I found treasure not where I thought  
Peace of mind can't be bought  
Still I believe  
  
[Chorus]  
I just hang on  
Suffer well  
Sometimes it's hard  
It's hard to tell  
  
An angel led me when I was blind  
I said take me back, I've changed my mind  
Now I believe  
From the blackest room, I was torn  
He called my name, a love was born  
So I believe

117,Depeche Mode,Surrender,"Laying on your holy bed  
by the hallowed door  
Feeling like an infidel  
Not worthy of your call  
Tempted by your innocence  
Beckoned to my fate  
I won't face the consequence  
I wouldn't hesitate  
  
I'm a man of flesh and bone  
Rapture, rushing through my veins  
Passion, flaming, in my heart  
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah  
  
Shackled like an animal  
Chained to my desires  
Just another sacrifice  
To love's eternal fires  
Tame me with your tenderness  
And break my brittle heart  
Easily and elegantly  
Tear my world apart  
  
I'm a man of flesh and bone  
Rapture, rushing through my vains  
Passion, flaming, in my heart  
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah  
  
We're living in a world full of illusion  
Everything is so unreal  
My mind is in a state of confusion  
But I can't deny the way I feel  
  
I'm a man of flesh and bone  
Rapture, rushing through my veins  
Passion, flaming, in my heart

118,Depeche Mode,Sweetest Perfection,"The sweetest perfection  
To call my own  
The slightest correction  
Couldn't finely hone  
The sweetest infection  
Of body and mind  
Sweetest injection  
Of any kind  
I stop and I stare too much  
Afraid that I care too much  
And I hardly dare to touch  
For fear that the spell may be broken  
When I need a drug in me  
And it brings out the thug in me  
Feel something tugging me  
Then I want the real thing not tokens  
The sweetest perfection...  
Things you'd expect to be  
Having effect on me  
Pass undetectedly  
But everyone knows what has got me  
Takes me completely  
Touches so sweetly  
Reaches so deeply  
I know that nothing can stop me  
Sweetest perfection  
An offer was made  
An assorted collection  
But I wouldn't trade  
The sweetest perfection...  
Takes me completely  
Touches so sweetly  
Reaches so deeply  
Nothing can stop me

119,Depeche Mode,The Bottom Line,"Like a cat dragged in from the rain  
Who goes straight back out and do i all over again  
I'll be back for more  
Something that is out of our hands  
Something we will never understand  
  
It's a hidden law  
The apple falls  
Destiny calls  
I follow you  
  
Like a pawn on the eternal board  
Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards  
I walk blindly on  
And heaven is in front of me  
Your heaven beckons me enticingly  
  
When I arrive it's gone  
The river flows  
The wise man knows  
I follow you  
  
I'm yearning I'm burning  
I feel love's wheels turning  
Like a moth on love's bright light  
I will get burned each and every night  
  
I'm dying to  
The sun will shine  
The bottom line  
I follow you

120,Depeche Mode,The Landscape Is Changing,"The landscape is changing  
The landscape is crying  
Thousands of acres of forest are dying  
Carbon copies from the hills above the forest line  
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside  
  
'Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere  
Just take good care of the world  
I don't case if you're going nowhere  
Just take good care of the world  
  
Now we're re-arranging  
There's no use denying  
Mountains and valleys, can't you hear them sighing  
Evolution, the solution or the certainty  
Can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy  
  
Token gestures, some semblance of intelligence  
Can we be blamed for the security of ignorance

121,Depeche Mode,The Love Thieves,"Oh the tears that you weep  
For the poor tortured souls  
Who fall at your feet  
With their love begging bowls  
All the clerks and the tailors  
The sharks and the sailors  
All good at their trades  
They'll always be failures  
Alms for the poor  
For the wretched disciples  
And the love that they swore  
With their hearts on the bible  
Beseeching the honor  
To sit at your table  
And feast on your holiness  
As long as they're able  
Love needs its martyrs  
Needs its sacrifices  
They live for your beauty  
And pay for their vices  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all lovers  
Your holding court  
With your lips and your smile  
Your body's a halo  
Their minds are on trial  
Sure as Adam is Eve  
Sure as Jonah turned whaler  
They're crooked love thieves  
And you are their jailer  
Love needs its martyrs  
Needs its sacrifices  
They live for your beauty  
And pay for their vices  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all others  
Love will be the death of  
My lonely soul brothers  
But their spirit shall live on in  
The hearts of all others

122,Depeche Mode,The Sinner In Me,"[Chorus]  
If I could just hide  
The sinner inside  
And keep him denied  
How sweet life would be  
If I could be free  
From the sinner in me  
  
I'll never be a saint  
That's not a picture that your memory paints  
Not renowned for my patience  
I'm not renowned for my restraint  
But you're always around  
You can always be found  
To pick me up when I'm on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm still recovering  
Still getting over all the suffering  
More known for my anger  
Than for any other thing  
But you've always tried  
To be by my side  
And catch my fall when I start to slide  
  
[Chorus]

123,Depeche Mode,The Sweetest Condition,"Taken in by the delicate noise  
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder  
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice  
Wandering around in silent wonder  
  
What chance did I have  
With the silver moon  
Hanging in the sky  
Opening old wounds?  
  
Taking hold of the hem of your dress  
Cleanliness only comes in small doses  
Bodily whole, but my head's in a mess  
Fueling obsession that borders psychosis  
  
It's a sad disease  
Creeping through my mind  
Causing disabilities  
Of the strangest kind  
  
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt  
There's a price that I pay for my mission  
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt  
How I suffer the sweetest condition  
  
Taken in by the delicate noise  
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder  
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice  
Wandering around in silent wonder

124,Depeche Mode,The Things You Said,"I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
But they know me better than that  
They know me better than that  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
I never denied them  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
How can a view become so twisted  
How can a view become so twisted  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
You tried them  
I get so carried away  
You brought me down to earth  
I thought we had something precious  
Now I know what it's worth  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I've never felt so disappointed  
Never felt so disappointed  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
Thought that you liked them  
They know me better than that

125,Depeche Mode,Two Minute Warning,"We're lying by the orange sky  
Two million miles across the land  
Scattered to the highest high  
Expect they'll either laugh or cry  
No sex, no consequence, no sympathy  
You're good enough to heat  
  
Two minute warning  
Two minutes later  
When time has come  
My days are numbered  
  
The dawning of another year  
Marks time for those who understand  
One in four still here  
While you and I go hand in hand  
No radio, no sound, no sin, no sanctuary  
So welcome to your last  
  
The sun, the solitude, the cemetery  
So welcome to your last

It's beginning to hurt  
Time you made up your mind  
Just what is it all worth  
  
All my useless advice  
All my hanging around  
All your cutting down to size  
All my bringing you down  
  
Watch the clock on the wall  
Feel the slowing of time  
Hear a voice in the hall  
Echoing in my mind  
  
All your stupid ideals  
Got your head in the clouds  
You should see how it feels  
With your feet on the ground  
  
Here I stand the accused  
With your fist in my face  
Feeling tired and bruised  
With the bitterest taste  
  
All my useless advice  
All my hanging around  
All your cutting down to size  
All my bringing you down  
  
All your stupid ideals  
Got your head in the clouds  
You should see how it feels  
With your feet on the ground

What the flesh requires  
Keeps the heart imprisoned  
  
What the spirit seeks  
The mind will follow  
When the body speaks  
All else is hollow  
  
I'm just an angel  
Driving blindly  
Through this world  
  
I'm just a slave here  
At the mercy  
Of a girl  
  
Oh, I need your tenderness  
Oh, I need your touch  
Oh, I dream of one caress  
Oh, I pray too much  
  
To the soul's desires  
The body listens  
What the flesh requires  
Keeps the heart imprisoned  
  
What the spirit seeks  
The mind will follow  
When the body speaks  
All else is hollow  
  
You keep me waiting  
For the promise  
That is mine  
  
Please stop debating  
Please stop wasting  
Your time  
  
Oh, I need your tenderness  
Oh, I need your touch  
Oh, I dream of one caress  
Oh, I pray too much

129,Depeche Mode,World Full Of Nothing,"Close  
Naked  
Skin on skin  
Tears are falling  
Tears of joy  
Her first boy  
His first girl  
Makes a change  
  
In a world full of nothing  
Though it's not love  
It means something  
  
She's lonely  
And he says  
It's for her only  
That he lusts  
She doesn't trust him  
Nothing is true  
But he will do  
  
In a world full of nothing  
Though it's not love  
It means something  
  
It's not easy to slip away  
And believe it all  
  
Though it's not love  
It means something

130,Depeche Mode,World In My Eyes,"Let me take you on a trip  
Around the world and back  
And you won't have to move  
You just sit still  
Now let your mind do the walking  
And let my body do the talking  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
I'll take you to the highest mountain  
To the depths of the deepest sea  
We won't need a map, believe me  
Now let my body do the moving  
And let my hands do the soothing  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
That's all there is  
Nothing more than you can feel now  
That's all there is  
Let me put you on a ship  
On a long, long trip  
Your lips close to my lips  
All the islands in the ocean  
All the heaven's in the motion  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
That's all there is  
Nothing more than you can touch now  
That's all there is  
Let me show you the world in my eyes

131,Elvis Costello,15 Petals,"Fifteen petals  
One for every year I spent with you  
Jewels and precious metals will never do  
  
I love you twisted  
And I love you straight  
I'd write it down but I can't concentrate  
Words won't me obey they do as they please  
And all I am left with is these...  
  
Fifteen petals  
One for every year I spent with you  
Jewels and precious metals will never do  
  
The thorn is blunted  
And the perfume will fade  
I stand where sun is set  
I crave the shade  
Down in the tavern with Mary and Joe  
Palms reached for alms as they throw  
  
Fifteen petals...  
One for every hour that we're apart  
Tears and useless battles  
I'll never start  
  
Mussolini highway  
There's a frankincense tree  
I picked some up there to carry with me  
You take me to places where I never go  
I love you more than you know  
  
Fifteen petals  
Scattered in the path where you will tread  
Fifteen petals  
Of vivid red  
  
One wine-bar vamp with the polythene  
Ein Panzer Kommander with no hair in place  
The crooked battalions drilled holes in the square

132,Elvis Costello,45,"Bells are chiming for victory  
There's a page back in history  
Forty five  
They came back to the world that they fought for  
Didn't turn out just like they thought  
Forty five  
  
Here is a song to sing to do the measuring  
What you lose, what you gain, what you win?  
  
Nine years later a child is born  
There's a record, so you put it on  
Forty five  
Nine years more, if we're lucky now  
Nine-year-old puts his money down  
Forty five  
Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat  
Every breath that I held for you  
Forty five  
There's a stack of shellac and vinyl  
Which is yours now and which is mine?  
Forty five  
  
Here is a song to sing to do the measuring  
What you lose, what you gain, what you win?  
  
Bass and treble heal every hurt  
There's a rebel in a nylon shirt  
But the words are a mystery, I've heard  
'Til you turn it down to thirty three and a third  
'Cause it helps with the elocution  
Corporations turn revolutions  
Forty five  
  
So don't you weep and shed  
Just change your name instead  
What you lose when it all goes to your head?  
  
I heard something peculiar said:  
""Perhaps he's got a shot and now he's dead""  
Forty five  
  
Bells are chiming and tears are falling  
It creeps up on you without a warning  
Forty five  
Every scratch, every click, every heartbeat  
Every breath that I bless  
I'd be lost, I confess  
Forty five

133,Elvis Costello,5Ive Gears In Reverse,"Five gears in reverse  
For girls looking at the big lift  
Somebody send out for the night nurse  
Please don't stick me on the late shift  
If you don't know by now  
Nobodys gonna tell you  
If you don't know by now  
The shock will probably kill you  
  
But if your patience is corrupted and you still cannot decide  
Youre sitting in the garage contemplating suicide  
And you have no motivation you can't even catch your breath  
All of this acceleration is driving you to death  
  
Five gears in reverse  
You think I don't know what I'm doing  
Another fashionable first  
Like walking down the road to ruin  
But if you're safe and sound  
Don't let me interrupt you  
And if you're gagged and bound  
Well how can I corrupt you  
  
Chorus

"
134,Elvis Costello,A Slow Drag With Josephine,"The snitch, the snoop, the tattletale  
Lead a threadbare up stairs  
Adieu, my little ballyhoo  
You broke my heart in two  
And now I haunt the bars and scent those trite affairs  
She went home to gather her comb  
And caught him unawares  
  
And there was her man enjoying the lay of the land  
He took a walk in the dark with a dish from the stand  
Girls and their creations  
Tight in the brightest grenadine  
But I'd take all that I've seen  
For a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Josephine, Josephine  
But I'd trade all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
Gavotte, garrotes, Cotillions and slow Arabesques  
Drum-rolls and Farandoles were all made in jest  
But when you make that move  
I can't resist  
When will you declare your armistice?  
  
Josephine, Josephine  
But I'd trade all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine  
  
In another time and place a different fate was cast  
He tried to skeddle-daddle-do  
She might have slapped him  
Just for saying ""Grant one more chance before you pass""  
""Then curse the nurse that named me the first or bury me at last""  
  
And in three-quarter time  
The true and the false  
Dancing the ""Hesitation Waltz""  
Then comes the ""flirtation""  
And temptation  
Hip, hip hooray  
Listen to what I say  
Then you can take it away

"
135,Elvis Costello,Abandoned Masquerade,"(Music by Diana Krall, lyrics by Elvis Costello)  
  
The glitter on a paint and plaster face  
Is covering desire and disgrace  
We could be lovers  
But no one suspects at all  
Once you're inside that costume ball  
And now I'm sitting here before the mirror  
I have the skill still to disguise my tears  
Then as the magic starts to fade  
I find myself abandoning the masquerade  
  
Even though you're suffering  
You try to hide it  
And pretend you're so nonchalant  
You can cry a pool of tears  
And sit beside it  
Then perhaps you'll know what you want  
  
I hope you never feel this much despair  
Or know the meaning of that empty chair  
As the illusions that we made all fade away  
In this abandoned masquerade

"
136,Elvis Costello,Accidents Will Happen,"Oh, I just don't know where to begin  
Love doesn't wait forever  
It's now or never  
But she keeps 'em hangin' on  
You said you're so alone  
She says she can't go home without a chaperon  
  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done  
  
There's so many fish in the sea  
That only rise up on the sweat and smoke of mercury  
But they keep you hangin' on  
They say you're so young  
Your mind is made up but your mouth is undone  
  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done  
  
It's the damage that we do we never know  
It's the words that we don't say that scare me so  
There's so many people to see  
So many people to hangin' on and add to your collection  
But they keep you hangin' on  
Until you well hung  
Your mouth is make up but your mind is undone  
  
Accidents will happen  
They're only hit and run  
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one  
Accidents will happen  
They only hit and run  
I don't want to hear it cause I know what it  
I know what it  
I know what it done  
I know (x4)

'Cause I love you just as much as I hate your guts

And you don't need anybody

Maybe Jesus wants you for a sunbeam

But if I've left something out  
I apologize  
But if you look in my eyes  
Then I'm sure you'll see...  
Alibis, alibis, alibis...  
  
Sometimes I'm so forgiving  
Everything seems bad to me  
But I can't go on living  
With this alibi, alibi, alibi...  
  
""Insane,"" what a mundane

And you only wanted to be famous

Sorry, but your mommy doesn't love you

Stop me if you've heard this...

138,Elvis Costello,Alison,"Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl.  
And with the way you look I understand  
That you are not impressed.  
But I heard you let that little friend of mine  
Take off your party dress.  
I'm not going to get too sentimental  
Like those other sticky valentines,  
'cause I don't know if you've been loving somebody.  
I only know it isn't mine.  
Alison, I know this world is killing you.  
Oh, Alison, my aim is true.  
  
Well I see you've got a husband now.  
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying  
In the wedding cake?  
You used to hold him right in your hand.  
I'll bet he took all he could take.  
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking  
When I hear the silly things that you say.  
I think somebody better put out the big light,  
Cause I can't stand to see you this way.  
  
Alison, I know this world is killing you.  
Oh, Alison, my aim is true.  
My aim is true

"
139,Elvis Costello,All This Useless Beauty,"It's at times such as this she'd be tempted to spit  
If she wasn't so ladylike  
She imagines how she might have lived  
Back when legends and history collide  
So she looks to her prince finding he's so charmingly  
Slumped at her side  
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall  
And she's waiting for passion or humor to strike  
  
What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?  
All this useless beauty  
  
Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time  
Till he almost began to negotiate  
She held his head like a baby and said ""it's okay if you cry""  
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldn't guess  
He desires to impress his associates  
But he's part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased  
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny  
  
[Chorus:]  
She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books  
That were later disgraced to face celluloid  
It won't even make sense, but you can bet  
If she isn't a sweetheart or plaything or pet  
The film turns her into an unveiled threat  
  
Nonsense prevails, modesty fails  
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity  
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise  
And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts  
They still think they're the gods of antiquity  
If something you missed didn't even exist  
It was just an ideal, is it such a surprise?  
  
[Chorus x 2]

"
140,Elvis Costello,Almost Blue,"Almost blue  
Almost doing things we used to do  
There's a girl here and she's almost you, almost  
All the things that your eyes once promised  
I see in hers too  
Now your eyes are red from crying  
  
Almost blue  
Flirting with this disaster became me  
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be  
  
Almost blue  
It's almost touching it will almost do  
There is part of me that's always true...always  
Not all good things come to an end now it is only a chosen few  
I've seen such an unhappy couple  
  
Almost me  
Almost you  
Almost blue

"
141,Elvis Costello,American Without Tears,"Outside in New Orleans the heat was almost frightening  
But my hotel room as usual was freezing and unkind  
On TV they prosecute anyone who's exciting  
So I put on my overcoat and went down to find  
  
In Revlon and Crimpelene they captured my heart  
To the strain of a piano and a cocktail murderess  
She was singing that ""It's Too Late"", I agreed with that part  
For two English girls who had changed their address  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it seems we've been crying for years and for years  
Now I don't speak any English, just American without tears  
Just American without tears  
  
One had been a beauty queen and the other was her friend  
They had known rogues and rascals and showbiz impresarios  
While the boys were licking Hitler they had something to defend  
From men armed with chewing gum and fine nylon hose  
By a bicycle factory as they sounded the siren  
And returned into the dance hall she knew he was the one  
Though he wasn't tall or handsome she laughed when he told her  
""I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham and this is Little John""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
At a dock in Southampton full of tearful goodbyes  
Newsreel commentators said ""Cheerio, G.I. brides""  
Soon they'll be finding the cold facts and lies  
New words for suspenders and young girls backsides  
  
Now I'm in America and running from you  
Like my grandfather before me walked the streets of New York  
And I think of all the women I pretend mean more than you  
When I open my mouth and I can't seem to talk  
  
Now it seems we've been crying for years and for years  
Now I don't speak any English just American without tears  
Just American without tears

"
142,Elvis Costello,...and In Every Home,"You turn to the sinister when you get the boot  
Sliding down the banister in your Sunday suit  
Lying on a slag heap of blankets and magazines  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
You'd better roll over and go to sleep if you don't come clean  
  
[Chorus:]  
And in every home there will be lots of time  
I will be all yours you might have been admired  
(And in every home there will be lots of time)  
They say they're very sorry but you are not desired  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Because they don't deserve us  
  
Holding your life in your hand  
With an artificial limp wrist  
And so a young blade becomes a has-been  
Looking for a new twist  
  
A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates  
He's in prison now she's running with his mates  
Sees him every Sunday  
And he asks her where she's been  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
She's going to cop a packet if he ever finds her  
In between the sheets  
  
[Chorus:]

143,Elvis Costello,Any King's Shilling,"You're a fine one, oh yes you are  
You're a fine one just like me  
And we're friends now, oh wouldn't you say?  
We've been friends now, oh haven't we?  
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you  
I can't say more it would be telling  
For if you don't what will become of you  
Just isn't worth any king's shilling  
  
I will answer when they make that call, pull upon this ragged uniform  
Up 'til now I know it's been your trade  
Spit and polish the potato parade  
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you  
I can't say more it would be telling  
For if you don't what will become of you  
Just isn't worth any king's shilling  
  
Please don't put your silly head in that pretty soldier's hat  
You've done your duty, that's enough of that  
  
I don't know if what I'm doing is right  
I don't know if you should be forgiving  
But for me it seems it means my life  
While for you it could just be a living  
Stay at home tonight if you know what's good for you  
I can't say more it would be telling  
For if you don't what will become of you  
Just isn't worth any king's shilling  
  
Please don't put your silly head in that British soldier's hat  
You've done your duty that's enough of that  
  
You're a fine one, oh yes you are  
You're a fine one, just like me

"
144,Elvis Costello,Ascension Day,"Not a soul was stirring  
Not a bird was singing, at least not within my hearing  
I was five minutes past caring  
Standing in the road just staring  
  
Thought I heard somebody pleading  
I thought I heard someone apologize  
Some fell down weeping  
Others shook their fists up at the skies  
And those who were left  
Seemed to be wearing disguises  
  
Now there's a queen in waiting  
Not enough loving and too much hating  
For the prince hidden within her man  
Always seems to be hesitating  
  
He said, ""Let her go, let her go, God bless her""  
""She hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her""  
""Except every minute of every hour of every day when I wish I could possess
her""  
  
Forty days passed by  
Forty alibis  
So carry on...that way  
And in time...you'll pay  
But we'll all be together  
Come Ascension Day  
  
Not a hound was howling  
Or whimpering or prowling  
Now the wind had departed  
Not a leaf was hanging on the tree like when it started  
  
But I know they will return  
Like they've never gone away  
Come Ascension Day

"
145,Elvis Costello,Baby It's You,"(Sha, la, la, la...)  
It's not the way you look that touched my heart.  
It's not the way you kissed me, baby, that tears me apart.  
Many, many nights I tried. I sit alone at home and I cried over you.  
What can I do? I can't help myself, cause baby, it's you.  
  
You should hear the things they say about you.  
They say you're never, ever, ever, ever gonna be true. Oh.  
I don't listen to a word they say. I'm gonna love you any old way.  
What can I do? It's true. I can't help myself, cause baby, it's you.  
  
I don't listen to a word they say. I'm gonna love you any old way.

146,Elvis Costello,Baby Plays Around,"It's not open to discussion anymore  
He's out again tonight and I'm alone once more  
He's all I have worth waiting for  
But baby plays around  
And so it seems I've always been the last to know  
To hold on to that girl, I had to let her go  
I wish to God I didn't love her so  
'Cos baby plays around  
  
I try to be strong hold on to my pride  
He doesn't even know it's wrong, how much  
I hurt inside  
And heaven knows I've tried  
But baby plays around. Just a plaything  
It's hard to reconcile the facts I'm facing  
  
It's not open to discussion anymore  
She walks those shiny streets  
I walk the worn out floor  
She's all I have worth living for  
Baby plays, baby plays around

"
147,Elvis Costello,Big Boys,"I am starting to function  
In the usual way  
Everything is so provocative  
Very very, temporary  
  
I shall walk (I shall walk)  
Out of this place (out of this place)  
I shall walk  
Out on you  
'Cause you go silly  
If she's willing  
Trying so hard to be like the big boys  
  
So you take her to the pictures  
Trying to become a fixture  
Inch by inch trying to reach her  
All the way through the second feature  
Worrying about your physical fitness  
Tell me how you got this sickness, oh ohhhh..  
  
I was caught in the suction  
By a face like a truncheon  
I was down upon one knee  
Stroking her vanity  
  
I was stuck on a hammerhead  
I came alive and left for dead  
As my face returned to red  
Choking on my pride and pity  
  
We can talk (we can talk)  
Until your face is blue ('til your face is blue)  
We can talk but she'll get to you  
After you've been loved and hated  
By the ones you've watched and waited  
Found that they were overrated  
  
She'll be the one - when the party's over  
She'll be the one - when the girls have gone home  
She'll be the one - that you'll wish you'd held onto  
She'll be the one - but it's too late for you to  
She'll be the one - who knows all your history  
She'll be the one -  
  
So you can cross her off your list  
And you try so hard  
And you try so hard  
And you try so hard  
To be like the big boys, oh.

148,Elvis Costello,Big Sister,"Sheep to the slaughter  
Oh, this must be love  
All your sons and daughters in a strangle, all with a kid glove  
Eyes like saucers, oh, you think she's a dish  
She is the blue chip that belongs to the big fish  
  
Big sister will be watching over you  
Sister see, sister do  
She's got to save me  
She's got you playing Russian Roulette  
Sport of kings, the old queen's heart  
The prince of darkness stole some tart  
It's in the papers, it's in the charts  
It's in the stop press before it all starts  
  
With a hammer and a slap 'n' tickle in inquisitive garments  
With all the style and finese purchase of armaments  
Compassion went out of fashion, that's all your concernment  
Sweat it out for thirty seconds on all the prudeness  
  
Big sister will be watching over you  
Sister see, sister do  
She's got to save me  
She's got you playing Russian Roulette  
She's got to save me  
She's got you playing Russian Roulette

149,Elvis Costello,Boy With A Problem,"I feel like a boy with a problem  
I can't believe what we've forgotten  
And I even slapped your face and made you cry  
  
It's the last thing I want to do  
Pull the curtains on me and you  
Pull the carpet from under love  
Pull out like young lovers do  
  
You swore you wouldn't shout  
If it's not your punch then its your pout  
Days in silence try my temper  
Nights spent drinking to remember  
How memories are always tender  
  
I crept out last night behind your back  
The little they know might be the pieces I lack  
Came home drunk  
Talking in circles  
The spirit is willing but I don't believe in miracles  
I've got a problem but let's go to bed  
I can roll over and I can play dead  
But here I am in the doghouse instead  
  
I feel like a boy with a problem  
I can't believe all you've forgotten  
Sleeping with forgiveness in your heart for me

"
150,Elvis Costello,Button My Lip,"Don't want to talk about the government  
Don't want to talk about some incident  
Don't want to talk about some peppermint gum  
Don't want to talk about the time to come  
  
Button my lip  
'Til I'm smart enough  
  
Don't raise your hand  
'Cos I'm not offering  
It serves you right  
Now you are suffering  
Give me a chance  
To see it though  
It all depends on what you hold is true  
  
Button my lip  
With your kiss  
  
Don't want to hear some little sniveling  
You just don't get what I'm delivering  
Maybe you want me  
But you know you can't  
I'd say, 'I want you?  
But you know I don't  
  
Button my lip  
'Til I'm old enough  
'Til I'm smart enough  
'Til I'm?  
Button my lip  
  
Don't want to come at your beckoning  
For any day they'll be a reckoning  
Don't want to hear what is impossible  
Baby, you've become invisible  
  
Button my lip  
  
I've seen those clowns vacant and insolent  
I stand accused but I am innocent  
I am the mighty and magnificent

151,Elvis Costello,Call On Me (Demo),"Everyday seem like Sunday  
It must be something that I have done  
I saw you dancing in the peep-show  
That every episode is leading me on  
  
I'm just another fool that you've got to humor  
Can't say I love you when it's just a rumor  
  
But if none of your dreams come true  
You can call on me, call on me  
'Cause I've seen dreams have a happy ending  
Disappearing on my tv, and you can call on me  
You can call on me, you can call on me, you can call on me  
  
When I go home I watch the television  
I go to sleep I dream about the television  
I go to work I talk about the television  
I used to think that love is something that it isn't  
  
Sometimes I feel just like a human being  
That's just something between you and me  
  
But if none of you dreams come true  
You can call on me, call on me  
'Cause I've seen dreams have a happy ending  
Disappearing on my tv, and you can call on me  
You can call on me, you can call on me, you can call on me

"
152,Elvis Costello,Coal Train Robberies,"Yesterday's coal train came to rest in the bitter cutting  
And as the signals took an age to change it was easy pickings  
So you go to the movies where they smash it up  
You want to feel your heart pumping it makes you feel good  
A few of the rookie cops were squealing the hits  
As another Mercedes-Benz gets blown to bits  
While all the time in the Camptown Theatres of Piccadilly  
They're going to throw a black-face minstrel show for the barefoot children  
That they're always selling  
They'll say ""It's quaint"" as the guilty ones faint  
And claim they ain't underneath this paint  
We interrupt these liberal saints with their whips and watermelon  
  
Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery  
It's like another world, or it had better be  
  
So we return to whitewashed pout of his committed lips  
Since he was declared the long lost fountain of youth  
That drips and drips and drips  
They'll be sending him round from door to door,  
To sell you back what's already yours  
""So many good deeds, so little time""  
Say the advertising agency swine  
When man has destroyed what he thinks he owns  
I hope no living thing cries over his bones  
If you don't believe that I'm going for good  
You can count the days I'm gone and chop up the chairs for firewood  
  
Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery  
It's like another world, or it had better be

"
153,Elvis Costello,Complicated Shadows,"Well you know your time has come and you're sorry for what you've done  
You should've never have been playing with a gun  
In those complicated shadows  
Well there's a line that you must toe  
And it'll soon be time to go  
But it's darker than you know in those complicated shadows  
  
All you gangsters and rude clowns  
Who were shooting up the town  
When you should have found someone to put the blame on  
Though the fury's hot and hard  
I still see that cold graveyard  
There's a solitary stone that's got your name on  
  
You don't have to take it from me  
But I know what I spake  
You think you're like iron and steel  
But iron and steel will bend and break  
In those complicated shadows  
  
Go!  
Sometimes justice you will find  
Is just dumb not color-blind  
And your poor shattered mind can't take it all in  
All those phantoms and those shades  
Should jump up on judgment day  
And say to the almighty ""I'm still stinking of sin""  
  
But the jury was dismissed  
Took his neck and they give it a twist  
So you see you won't be missed in those complicated shadows  
  
You can say just what you like in a voice like a John Ford film  
Take the law into your hands  
You will soon get tired of killing  
In those complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
Complicated shadows  
  
Go!

154,Elvis Costello,Couldn't You Keep That To Yourself,"The tiny slip at midnight  
A little sip at noon  
You're tired and torn approaching dawn  
My penitent buffoon  
Wouldn't you think I'd know by now  
I shouldn't have entertained it  
Couldn't you keep that to yourself  
You cried for my forgiveness  
You say it sets you free  
You summon dear the shameful tears  
That spill all over me  
Wouldn't you think I'd know by now  
I shouldn't have entertained it  
Couldn't you keep that to yourself  
  
The penny rides at evening tide  
The vain requests  
The blush of the night  
And the blooming bush  
Where you failed every test  
What should I believe of you?  
What should I forget  
Am I innocent yet  
  
Is it the wife you would have beaten  
Is it the child you couldn't bear?  
I fear you have mistaken me  
For somebody who cares  
The sophisticated victim  
That you skilfully request  
You can hide behind your wishes  
You can hide behind despair  
And all the wretched syndroms  
That carry away the blame  
Couldn't you keep you keep that to yourself  
And wouldn't you shouldn't you couldn't you  
Keep that to yourself

"
155,Elvis Costello,Country Darkness,"This tattered document  
A mystery you can solve  
Some burnt out filament  
Flies buzzing around the bulb  
  
Country darkness  
  
He thought of traveling  
Heard an approaching train  
Drown out his desperate pulse  
A song with no refrain  
  
Country darkness  
  
She daydreams forbidden sings  
There must be something more  
The prison she lives in  
The one with the open door  
  
Country darkness  
  
The veil is covering  
A glistening and cruel blade  
Suffer little children  
Repent, unfaithful maid  
  
Country darkness

156,Elvis Costello,Crawling To The U.s.a.,"I thought I would go to the sea and shrink down very tiny  
And slide inside the telephone wire that runs under the briny  
Till I found there is a way of crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
Saw it late one night on a secret channel  
It's farther on along the tunnel  
It's way beyond the final station  
That's the one they never mention  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
You don't have to pay them that much  
You had better bring your lunch  
It's undercover, around the houses  
Up your skirt and down your trousers  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.  
  
She said, ""I catch you taking liberties and they do not impress me  
Attach me to your credit card and then you can undress me  
Everybody is on their knees except the Russians and the Chinese  
  
You had better not go too far  
There's one way out, there's only one way  
Leave your mother and your father  
Crawling to the U.S.A.

"
157,Elvis Costello,Damnation's Cellar,"Did anybody notice, over marmalade and eggs  
In between the princess' legs  
What with wars and floods and beggars  
Not to mention stocks and shares  
If you have a moment to spare  
Can you write and reassure me that I have seen  
They're constructing a time machine  
There will be no need for the obituary pages  
We can have any hero from the bygone ages  
'Til the truth emerges, the argument rages  
  
[Chorus:]  
The major and the minor  
Turn from tallow into tar  
Should we leave them in their place?  
Down in damnation's cellar  
  
When any form of deity that you might enjoy  
Can be conjured with a test-tube and a flame  
If it's out there then science can explain it  
Or at least remove the blame  
And if there's is anyone you'd like to see again  
The speak up quickly  
  
Send us back Da Vinci then we don't have to ponder  
The maddening smile of ""La Giaconda""  
The critics say Nijinsky, the dancer, of course  
While the punters would probably prefer the horse  
You'll find it's quicker than history, cheaper than divorce  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bring back Liberace or Ollie and Stan  
Shakespeare will have to wait his turn  
Elvis Presley and Puccini shall return  
I suppose we live and learn, though it's hard to believe as we  
Cheerfully burn  
It's curious  
Some will call for justice.  
There are murders to solve  
What about Hitler? or at least lee Harvey Oswald  
Give us this day and everything we squander  
Anyone beautiful  
Somebody blonder  
They'll never please mankind, so lie back and enjoy it  
Stop press: they've just decided to destroy it  
  
[Chorus:]

"
158,Elvis Costello,"Darling, You Know I Wouldn't Lie","Here I am late again for the last time  
And like I promised, I just told her goodbye  
Please believe me 'cause this time, it's really over  
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie  
Didn't I come and tell you about her  
How temptation lured she and I  
Now I know it was only fascination  
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie  
I had to let her down easy as slow as I could  
After all, she's got feelings too  
But it took a little longer than I thought it would  
But this time, she knows we're really through  
She wanted to hold me forever  
And this lipstick shows her final try  
And these tears on my shoulder are proof that she failed  
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie

"
159,Elvis Costello,Dear Sweet Filthy World,"Dear sweet filthy world, my wife or whoever reads this  
I think that I've lived too long  
With all of my promise unfulfilled  
But there is a veil drawn over all of that  
  
I know you'll probably say, ""spare us the melodrama""  
""I don't know how he chose the pills or the stupid revolver""  
I'm out of luck  
I'm not that strong  
My hands, your neck  
I might have wrung  
  
Don't try to find me  
I'm not worth anything anymore  
I am not leaving you with all of your problems  
The biggest one is me  
  
Life is dark  
Cold as the sea  
Embrace me in my anguish  
Put seaweed in my hair and vow that you won't cry because  
I've gone  
I can't go on, I can't go on, I can't go on  
I must close now

"
160,Elvis Costello,Deep Dark Truthful Mirror,"One day you're going to have to face  
A deep dark truthful mirror  
And it's going to tell you things that I still love you too much to say  
The sky was just a purple bruise, the ground was iron  
And you fell all around the town until you looked the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie from  
Your tongue trips  
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror  
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror  
  
Now the flagstone streets where the newspaper shouts ring to the boots of
roustabouts  
But you're never in any doubt, there's something happening somewhere  
  
You chase down the road 'til your fingers bleed  
On a fiberglass tumbleweed  
  
You can blow around the town, but it all shuts down the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So you bay for the boy in the tiger-skin trunks  
They set him up, set him up on the stool  
He falls down, falls down like a drunk  
And you drink 'til you drool  
And it's his story you'll flatter  
You'll stretch him out like a saint  
But the canvas that he splattered will be the  
Picture that you never paint  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A stripping puppet on a liquid stick gets into it pretty thick  
A butterfly drinks a turtle's tears, but how do you know he really needs it?  
  
As a butterfly feeds on a dead monkey's hand,  
Jesus wept he felt abandoned  
You're spellbound baby there's no doubting that  
Did you ever see a stare like a Persian cat?  
  
[Chorus]

"
161,Elvis Costello,Different Finger,"Please put your rings on a diffrent finger if you meet me tonight  
Cause I can't stand those suspicious glances  
Cause I know the things they're saying are right  
  
They're saying why don't you straighten up  
And see what youve got to lose  
Put it all down to fate but you still got the chance to choose  
  
I don't want to hear your whole life story  
Or about my strange resemblance to some old flame  
All I want is one night of glory  
I don't even know your second name  
  
Please put your rings on a diffrent finger cause weve got so much at stake  
I can't stand those suspicious glances  
Cause they seem to cover evry move I make  
  
But if I can be alone with you completely tonight  
Put your rings on a diffrent finger  
Before I turn out the light

"
162,Elvis Costello,Dirty Rotten Shame,"I recall the good old days  
But thankfully, they've gone  
Now the ponies all are broken nags  
That stumble as they groan  
And throw the jockeys from their throne  
When there are pitches left to dodge  
And lions left to tame  
But it's nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
It's a dirty rotten shame  
That when you're frivolous and strong  
It isn't youth, its fearlessness  
That has been wasted on the young  
The cruel are in the cradle  
And the bishop's in the bag  
It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
  
Now I find life a millionaire  
That brags for rags and jewels  
A snarling pup is wild enough  
But as his anger proves  
He's left to sharpen useless tools  
That tear and graze and finer phrase  
But few are worth the name  
It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame  
  
It's a dirty rotten shame  
And that is not an idle boast  
When all your courage and your strength  
Will leave you as you need it most  
When there are lamps to dampen  
And cauliflowers to flip  
It's nothing but a dirty rotten shame

"
163,Elvis Costello,Dissolve,"Sugar cube drop into a yellow cup  
What makes the world just waking up  
Resolve?  
Dissolve  
Who knows where on earth it's going to stop?  
I can't hear you 'cause we're breaking up  
Dissolve  
  
And the stones in the track make work for the mechanic  
The birds all fly from the branches in a panic  
And a back-fire echoes down the hillside  
As the last headline report dies  
Dissolve  
  
Ice is melting at the distant Pole  
The gin and tonic glasses overflow  
Dissolve  
The precious little else that I could say  
Your stupid tears of laughter washed away  
Dissolve  
  
While the poisonous light pours from the picture palace  
And it flickers on, tries so hard to be scandalous  
A child keeps beating on a toy drum  
And the tablets dropped on your tongue  
Dissolve  
  
""So salute me in moving frame""  
""I might not be there when you look again""  
The mourning border card behind the clock  
The hour that he passed, unwound and stopped  
Dissolve

"
164,Elvis Costello,Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,"Baby can you understand me now  
Sometimes I feel a little mad  
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel  
When things go wrong I seem to be mad  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Baby sometimes I'm so carefree  
With a joy that's hard to hide  
Other times it seems that all I have to do is worry  
And then I know you're bound to see my other side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I get mad at you I want you to know  
That I never mean to take it out on you  
Life has its problems and I get my share  
But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you  
Oh don't you know I'm human  
I've got my faults just like any one  
Sometimes I lie awake long regretting  
Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done  
  
[Chorus:x3]

"
165,Elvis Costello,...dust,"If dust could only talk  
What would we hear it say?  
Before it's brushed aside  
Just as it's swept away  
  
It's just the evidence  
It's of no consequence  
It's only flesh and bone  
Why don't you leave it alone?  
  
If dust could only gather into lines of chalk  
Around a silhouette detective fiction walks  
For it's the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
Why did they dam the land?  
How did they flood the plain?  
Did they erase the name?  
And wipe away the stain  
You kept your mouth well shut  
Appeared to turn your coat  
Now there's a name for you but it's stuck in my throat  
  
If dust could only mutter  
Or in laughter trill  
If it could warn and whisper from the windowsill  
For it's the only witness that can testify  
Can I spit out the truth?  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
Here comes the juggernaut  
Here come The Poisoners  
They choke the life and land  
And rob the joy from us  
Why do they taste of sugar  
When they are made of money  
Here come the Lamb of God  
And the butcher's boy, Sonny  
  
If dust could only gather in a needle track  
Then it would skip a beat and it would jump right back  
If dust could only gather in a needle track  
Then it would skip a beat  
And all the sense I lack

"
166,Elvis Costello,Edith And The Kingpin,"The big man arrives  
Disco dancers greet him  
Plainclothes cops greet him  
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening  
Sophomore jive  
From victims of typewriters  
The band sounds like typewriters  
The big man he's not listening  
His eyes hold edith  
His left hand holds his right  
What does that hand desire  
That he grips it so tight  
  
Edith in the ring  
The passed-over girls are conferring  
The man with the diamond ring is purring  
All claws for now withdrawn  
One by one they bring  
His renegade stories to her  
His crimes and his glories to her  
In challenge they look on  
Women he has wanted grow old too soon  
He tilts their tired faces  
Gently to the spoon  
  
Edith in his bed  
A plane in the rain is humming  
The wires in the walls are humming  
Some song-some mysterious song  
Bars in her head  
Beating frantic and snowblind  
Romantic and snowblind  
She says-his crime belongs  
Edith and the kingpin  
Each with charm to sway  
Are staring eye to eye  
They dare not look away  
You know they dare not look away

I ain't telling you jealous  
It's just the natural truth

My money's gone, the fun is gone  
The way things look I can't be here long  
Oh oh oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
Taking all my money to pay the tax  
I'm telling you people the natural facts  
I'm telling you people, in my belief  
I am headed straight on relief  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
I ain't got a dime, ain't got a cent  
Ain't got no money to pay my rent  
She wants some clothes, she wants some shoes  
I'm telling you people I don't know what to do  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Talking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
Taking all my money to pay the tax

I'm telling you people, in my belief  
I am headed straight on relief  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Thinking about me and you and what on earth are we gonna do?  
  
Oh I got the Eisenhower Blues  
Talking about me and you and what the hell are we gonna do?

168,Elvis Costello,Either Side Of The Same Town,"Nothing will ever be the same  
All of the promises we made seem hollow  
But there are still streets in this town  
Marked with your shadow  
  
So if you see me, look surprised  
If you don't then pass me by  
And I may even brush your sleeve  
As you turn to leave  
  
Now it's hard to act like strangers  
When we used to be so strong  
Everything is changing  
And most of it is wrong  
What do we know of anything?  
Two fools of some renown  
Either side of the same town  
  
Somewhere there's a light  
I can sense it  
Oh, though I may fall back again  
Although it's a fight  
I know I must remain  
  
Now it's hard to keep ignoring  
Someone you recognize  
And if I seem contented  
It's only my disguise  
What do we know of anything?  
Two fools of some renown  
Either side of the same town

169,Elvis Costello,Get Yourself Another Fool,"At last I've awakened to see what you've done.  
All I can do is pack up and run.  
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.  
You said that you loved me. I was yours to command.  
Your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand.  
You played me for a fool. Find yourself another fool.  
And now, now that we're through, you say you wished you'd be true.  
Oh, but deep down in my heart, I know our love could never grow.  
And now, now that we're through, you say you wished you'd be true.  
Oh, but deep down in my heart, I know our love will never grow.  
At last I've awakened to see what you've done.  
All I can do is pack up and run.  
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.  
Now I know the rules. Find yourself another fool.

170,Elvis Costello,Ghost Train,"Maureen and Stan were looking for a job  
They got songs for every occasion  
And a little limelight robbery  
No one will employ them  
There's nothing to decide  
So he autographs his overdraft  
While she goes out of her mind  
Stuck on the wall with a thousand faces  
Unwanted posters of the haunted places  
  
[Chorus]  
Roll up for the ghost train  
Non-stop through the city  
Step right up and show your face  
We only want the pretty ones  
Roll up for the ghost train  
Non-stop through the city  
Step right up and show your face  
We only want the pretty ones  
  
Maureen and Stan at the skating rink  
Looking for the drummer who threw up in the sink  
Laughing and singing, dressed up like dice  
Maybe they could freeze to death out there on the ice  
Look at the graceful way she dances  
On foot speaks, the other answers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She plays the queen of the fleapit  
He plays a Spanish guitar  
He got a black eye from a waitress  
She's not seeing any stars  
You can be refused, you can be replaced  
You can change your name but you can't change your face  
While they make believe it's just another holiday  
They turn on each other when they hear that joker say  
  
Roll up for the ghost train  
Non-stop through the city  
Step right up and show your face  
We only want the pretty ones  
Roll up for the ghost train  
We only want the pretty ones

171,Elvis Costello,Glitter Gulch,"Enter Madam X painted in a shocking pink spangled dress  
Her teeth are perfect but her mouth is loose  
Rubbing their hands together she persuades them that it's better to confess  
Which unpleasant fate they'd like to choose  
  
[Chorus]  
Every step might be your last  
Money signs are in your eyes sucker  
You've been taken in this time  
You might just get out alive if you're lucky  
All the vultures tuning in to Glitter Gulch  
Are looking in on you  
And they're hungry  
  
He stood five feet tall in his elevator shoes and stovepipe hat  
He was known by several different names  
Prompted by Madam X he answered all their questions  
And then after that he said I'm sick and tired of stupid games  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We've got prizes if you can afford  
Some small humiliation before you get your reward  
And I'd rather be an outlaw than an in-law to you  
And to live my life in miserable poverty  
Than to have to grovel to have some dream home hovel  
So watch me while I get away with prime time robbery  
  
As he enters Madam X he things of red raged faces and the sweet greenbacks  
He climbed upon his honey and he covered her with money  
As they do their victory dance  
He thinks I hope they choke upon their laughter tracks  
They can all go straight to hell while we howl down the whole hotel

"
172,Elvis Costello,Gloomy Sunday,"Sunday is gloomy, my hours are slumberless  
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless  
Little white flowers will never awaken you  
Not when the black coach of sorrow has taken you  
Angels have no thought of ever returning you  
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all  
My heart and I have decided to end it all  
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad, I know  
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go  
Death is no dream, for in death I am caressing you  
With the last breath of my heart I'll be blessing you  
Gloomy Sunday  
  
Dreaming, I was only dreaming  
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart, deep  
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you  
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you  
Gloomy Sunday

173,Elvis Costello,God Give Me Strength,"(words sung by the character in the movie given in brackets)  
Now I have nothing, so God give me strength  
Cause Im weak in her [his] wake  
And if Im strong I might still break  
And I don't have anything to share  
That I wont throw away into the air  
  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out [this belle is wrung out]  
[he] she was the light that I'd bless  
[he] she took my last chance at happiness  
So God give me strength, God give me strength  
  
I can't hold onto [him] her, God give me strength  
When the phone doesnt't't ring  
And Im lost in imagining  
Everything that kind of love is worth  
As I tumble back down to the earth  
  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out  
[he] she was the light that I'd bless  
[he] she took my last chance at happiness  
So God give me strength,  
  
God if [hed] she'd grant me [his] her indulgence and decline  
I might as well wipe [him] her from my memory  
Fracture the spell as [he] she becomes my enemy  
Maybe I was washed out like a lip-print on his shirt  
See, Im only human, I want him to hurt  
I want him  
I want him to hurt  
  
[instrumental]  
Since I lost the power to pretend  
That there could ever be a happy ending  
  
That song is sung out  
This bell is rung out  
[he] she was the light that I'd bless  
[he] she took my last chance at happiness  
So God give me strength, God give me strength

"
174,Elvis Costello,God's Comic,"I wish you'd known me when I was alive, I was a funny feller  
The crowd would hoot and holler for more  
I wore a drunk's red nose for applause  
Oh yes I was a comical priest  
""With a joke for the flock and a hand up your fleece""  
Drooling the drink and the lipstick and greasepaint  
Down the cardboard front of my dirty dog-collar  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm dead, now I'm dead, now I'm dead,  
Now I'm dead, now I'm dead  
And I'm going on to meet my reward  
I was scared, I was scared, I was scared, I was scared  
He might of never heard God's Comic  
  
So there he was on a water-bed  
Drinking a cola of a mystery brand  
Reading an airport novelette, listening to Andrew Lloyd-Webber's ""Requiem""  
He said, before it had really begun, ""I prefer the one about my son""  
""I've been wading through all this unbelievable  
Junk and wondering if I should have given  
The world to the monkeys""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm going to take a little trip down Paradise's endless shores  
They say that travel broadens the mind, 'til you can't get your head out of
doors  
  
I'm sitting here on the top of the world  
I hang around in the longest night  
Until each beast has gone bed and then I say  
""God bless"" and turn out the light  
While you lie in the dark, afraid to breathe and you beg and you promise  
And you bargain and you plead  
Sometimes you confuse me with Santa Claus  
It's the big white beard I suppose  
I'm going up to the pole, where you folks die of cold  
I might be gone for a while if you need me  
  
Now I'm dead, now I'm dead, now I'm dead,  
Now I'm dead, now I'm dead and you're all  
Going on to meet your reward  
  
Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared?  
Are you scared?  
You might have never heard, but God's comic

"
175,Elvis Costello,Good Year For The Roses,"I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray  
Lyin' cold the way you left 'em, but at least your lips caressed them while  
You packed  
Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't
drink  
But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say  
For me  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin'  
Funny I don't even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
It's been a good year for the roses  
  
After three full years of marriage, it's the first time that you haven't  
Made the bed  
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we  
Haven't said  
While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind, I find I haven't said a
word  
From the bedroom the familiar sound of a baby's cryin' goes unheard  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin'  
Funny I don't even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
It's been a good year for the roses

"
176,Elvis Costello,Goon Squad,"Mother, Father, I'm here in the zoo  
I can't come home 'cause I've grown up too soon  
I got my sentence  
I got my command  
They said they'd make me major if I met all their demands  
  
I could be a corp'ral into corp'ral punishment  
Or the gen'ral manager of a large establishment  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought they'd put me in the  
  
Goon squad  
They've come to look you over and they're giving you the eye  
Goon squad  
They want you to come out to play  
You'd better say goodbye  
  
Some grow just like their dads  
And some grow up too tall  
Some go drinking with the lads  
Some are no fun at all  
  
And you must find the proper place  
For everything you see  
But you'll never get to make a lampshade out of me  
  
I could join a chain of males or be the missing link  
Looking for a lucky girl to put me in the pink  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought they'd put me in the  
  
Good squad...  
  
Mother, Father, I'm doing so well  
I'm making such progress now that you can hardly tell  
I fit in a little dedication  
With one eye on the clock  
They caught you under medication  
You could be in for a shock  
  
Thinking up the alibis that ev'ryone's forgotten  
Just another mummy's boy gone to rotten  
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod  
But I never thought they'd put me in the  
  
Goon squad...

"
177,Elvis Costello,Green Shirt,"There's a smart young woman on a light blue screen  
Who comes into my house every night.  
And she takes all the red, yellow, orange and green  
And she turns them into black and white.  
  
But you tease, and you flirt  
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt  
You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it  
  
Better cut off all identifying labels  
Before they put you on the torture table  
  
'Cause somewhere in the ""Quisling Clinic""  
There's a shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes  
She's listening in to the Venus line  
She's picking out names  
I hope none of them are mine  
  
But you tease, and you flirt...  
  
Never said I was a stool pigeon  
I never said I was a diplomat  
Everybody is under suspicion  
But you don't want to hear about that  
  
'Cause you tease, and you flirt...  
  
Better send a begging letter to the big investigation  
Who put these fingerprints on my imagination?  
  
You tease, and you flirt...  
  
You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it  
You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it

"
178,Elvis Costello,Hand In Hand,"No, don't ask me to apologize  
I won't ask you to forgive me  
If I'm gonna go down, you're gonna come with me  
  
You say, ""Why don't you be a man about it  
Like they do in the grown-up movies?""  
But when it comes to the other way around  
You say you just want to use me  
Oh, you and you wonder whether  
It's gonna be syndicated  
You sit with your knees together  
All the time your breath is bated  
  
Hand in hand  
No, don't ask me to apologize  
I won't ask you to forgive me  
If I'm gonna go down, you're gonna come with me  
  
Don't you know I got the bully boys out  
Changing someone's facial design  
Sitting with my toy room lout  
Polishing my precious china  
Don't you know I'm an animal  
But don't you know I can't stand up steady  
But you can't show me any kind of hell  
That I don't know already  
  
Hand in hand  
No, don't ask me to apologize  
I won't ask you to forgive me  
If I'm gonna go down, you're gonna come with me  
Hand in hand, hand in hand, hand in hand

"
179,Elvis Costello,Heart-shaped Bruise,"Tell me now  
Or are you teasing?  
I felt the cold hard facts of life  
Five degrees from freezing  
Does it amuse you to always  
Hurt me so?  
It try my best it's not enough  
Should I give up and let you?  
  
What more is there to take from me?  
There's nothing else to give you, dear  
There's nothing more that I can lose  
Except this heart shaped bruise  
  
It will fade  
From purple to violet  
It will fade  
Just as the day dissolves into twilight  
  
Tell me now  
Or am I only dreaming?  
You said that you'd be mine for life  
And now you say you're leaving  
If I could hold you once more  
Before you go  
When I approach you just lash out  
Should I give up and let you?  
  
What more is there to take from me?  
There's nothing left give you, dear  
There's nothing else that I can lose  
Except this heart shaped bruise  
  
It will fade from purple to violet  
It will fade...  
She's pulling out the pin

"
180,Elvis Costello,He's Got You,"I got the picture that you gave to me  
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got the picture, he's got you  
  
I got the records that we used to share  
And they still sound the same, as when you were here  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got the records, he's got you  
  
I got your memory, or has it got me?  
I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be  
  
I got your class ring that proves you care  
And it still looks the same as when you gave it dear  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got these little things, he's got you  
  
I got your memory, or has it got me?  
I really don't know, but I know it won't let me be  
  
I got the picture that you gave to me  
And it's signed with love, just like it used to be  
The only thing different, the only thing new  
I got these little things, he's got you

"
181,Elvis Costello,Hidden Shame,"I'm sorry to say that you don't know me  
I'm sad in ways you never understood  
Each time I try to tell the ugly truth  
You always let it pass you by  
  
You said I'd never tell you a lie  
Just because I could  
Did you really think I was a bad man?  
  
You always said that that should be my middle name  
But you don't know the half of it  
You don't know how that name fits  
You don't know my hidden shame  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
  
Well, there's a different kind of prison  
And it don't even have to look much like a cell  
It's already on your mind, boy, we can see it in your eyes  
So, here's the bars and walls as well  
  
Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe  
You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name  
Sure it's easy to be strong  
When you know the charge is wrong  
But the days and weeks get long  
When you've got a hidden shame  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
  
I had a friend when I was just a boy  
We were like brothers, we would run and hide  
And we went walking on a high hillside  
And I really don't how it happened  
  
He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye  
And not a single word was spoken  
I must have pushed him but I don't remember why  
And all at once, he lay there broken  
And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
  
They say you always hurt the one you love  
And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't  
But like my shame that kind of love is always hidden  
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head  
They never got me for the thing I really did  
  
Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

"
182,Elvis Costello,High Fidelity,"Some things you never get used to  
Even though you're feeling like another man  
There's nothing that he can do for you  
To shut me away as you walk through  
Lovers laughing in their amateur hour  
Holding hands in the corridors of power  
Even though I'm with somebody else right now  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
There's a new kind of dedication  
Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel  
Maybe I got above my station  
Maybe you're only changing channel  
  
Even though you're nowhere near me  
And I know you kiss him so sincerely now  
Even though the signal's indistinct  
And you worry what silly people think  
Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out  
I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions  
I suppose he'll never know about  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?

"
183,Elvis Costello,Home Truth,"I hung up the phone tonight  
Just as you said I love you  
Once this would have been coincidence  
Now these things start to bother me  
You still close your eyes when I kiss you  
And I close mine too  
But we didn't open them again  
Quite as wide as we should  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
Does your touch feel the same as it should do  
Or is it someone quite similar  
Who killed me with kindness last night  
Now do I look at all familiar?  
But none of these things seem to matter  
Since we've grown apart  
I'd put back the pieces of what's shattered  
But I don't know where to start  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
And I feel like a clown  
It's tearing me up  
It's tearing me down  
  
You say which are the lies that you tell me  
Well where do I begin?  
So I turn on the TV again  
And the world comes crashing in  
Is it my shirt or my toothpaste  
That is whiter than white?  
Is it the lies that I tell you  
Or the lies that I might?  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends  
  
This is where the home truth ends  
This is where the home truth ends

184,Elvis Costello,"Honey, Are You Straight Or Are You Blind?","Who do you see when you turn your eyes down?  
Who do you see when I'm not seeing you?  
The news is out all over town and all these girls  
Are taking turns at being you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well, well, well  
You'd better make up your mind  
Honey, are you straight or are you blind?  
  
She's coming in between us you know that she is  
I'm not holding on to her but one of us is  
My hands are in my pocket, my face is in a book  
She could walk 'round naked and I wouldn't sneak a look  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Honey are you straight or are you blind?  
  
She walked in and your eyes flew out the door  
You squeezed my hand 'til the circulation ceases  
She's just a doll like so many more  
She's the kind of doll that you'd like to pull to pieces  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, well, well  
You'd better make up your mind  
Honey are you straight or are you blind?

185,Elvis Costello,How Deep Is The Red,"Is this is not a pretty tale?  
Is this not a riddle?  
A bow shoots arrows through the air  
A bow drags notes from a fiddle  
But who is the beau of a young girl's heart?  
That a king may send to battle  
Is this not a pretty tale?  
Is this not a riddle?  
If red is the breast of soldier's tunic hung with a silver medal  
And red is the thorn that protects the rose,  
A deeper red than the petal  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled,  
The debt of our sins to settle?  
How deep is the red?  
How deep is the red?  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled?  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled?  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
Is this is not a pretty tale?  
Is this not a riddle?  
A bow shoots arrows through the air  
A bow drags notes from a fiddle  
But who is the beau of a young girl's heart?  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??  
How deep is the red??

"
186,Elvis Costello,How Much I Lied,"Darling, there is one thing I must tell you, you must know  
It's so hard to say the words I feel  
This fancy that I'm on has been going on too long  
It's time to stop pretending things are real  
  
'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind  
And I just don't know what's right or wrong  
To take a chance on losing you is such a silly thing to do  
A chance I might wake up and find you gone  
  
Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue  
Any private flame could be a lie  
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you  
But I know I'll only make you cry  
  
A thief can only steal from you  
He cannot break your heart  
He can never touch the precious things inside  
Someone like you should surely be  
  
Miles and miles away from me  
Then you'd never care how much I lied  
So try to understand the pain  
It takes so long when I explain  
Please don't you forget how much I lied  
How much I lied

"
187,Elvis Costello,How To Be Dumb,"I was hell-bent on destroying my powers of concentration  
While you were living like a saint  
And all the time the very one you trusted was washing off  
Somebody else's paint  
  
Now you've got yourself a brand new occupation  
Every fleeting thought is a pearl  
And beautiful people stampede to the doorway  
Of the funniest fucker in the world  
  
They're here to help you  
Satisfy your desire  
There's a bright future for all you professional liars  
  
[Chorus]  
Now you know how to be dumb  
Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?  
Don't you know how to be dumb?  
Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes  
  
They emptied out all the asylums, they emptied out all the jails  
The ""new bruise"" was the name of a dance craze  
By ""Jesus cross and the cruel nails""  
Followed up by ""torturing little beaver""  
With their contraption of barbed wire  
Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require  
They'll be howling by midnight, they'll be drooling by dawn  
Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains  
Heads shaven and shorn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trapped in the house of the perpetual sucker  
Where bitterness always ends so pitifully  
You always had to dress up your envy in some half-remembered  
Philosophy  
  
Now you're masquerading as pale powdered genius  
Whose ever bad intention has been purged  
You could've walked out any time you wanted but face it you  
Didn't have the courage  
I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of  
Twisted dilettante  
Funny though people don't usually get so ugly 'til they think  
They know what they want  
Scratch your own head stupid  
Count up to three  
Roll over on your back  
Repeat after me  
  
Don't you know how to be dumb?  
Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?  
Don't you know how to be dumb?  
Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes

"
188,Elvis Costello,Human Hands,"I've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me  
Oh darling how I miss you  
I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness  
I crave the silhouette of your kiss  
With only the blue light of the tv on  
Lip reading threats and false alarms  
There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself  
And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt  
That it's you that I'm dreaming about  
Do I have to draw you a diagram?  
All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands  
  
With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze  
Checkmate in three moves in your heyday  
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore  
Now you're part of someone else  
  
On the factory floor and you still say ""Wheres the action?""  
Now you manufacture happiness  
And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
All you toy soldiers and scaremongers  
Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder  
In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before  
  
Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly  
You know I love you more than slightly  
Although I've never said it like this before  
  
[Chorus:]

"
189,Elvis Costello,Human Touch,"I know I've just gotta get out of this place  
I can't stand any more of that mechanical grace  
Though you say it's only industrial squeeze  
It looks like luxury and feels like a disease  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh give it to me, give it to me  
I don't want to know much about much  
Give it to me, give it to me  
I need, I need, I need the human touch  
  
Left with just a house to hold  
Drinking your way to drydock  
It's easy to break up a model citizen  
Living in the state of shock  
  
I just can't believe I am responsible for this  
What the makeup hides can't be hidden with a kiss  
  
When I'm talking in tongues I go where you lead  
I don't make you plead, oh I need you  
How I'd like to fix her in a picture of rage  
How I'd like to catch her when she's acting her age  
But when she's laying stretched out on the floor  
It's no mystery to me anymore  
  
[Chorus]

"
190,Elvis Costello,Hurry Down Doomsday,"The man in the corner of this picture has a sinister purpose  
In the teeming temple of the Railroad Kings  
He's planting a trashy paperback book for accidental purchase  
Containing all the secrets of life and other useless things  
  
But I can't bring myself to look  
Wake up zombie, write yourself another book  
You want to scream and shout my little flaxen lout  
Hurry down Doomsday, the bugs are taking over  
  
She sleeps in the shirt of a late, great country singer  
Stretched out on her poor jealous husband's pillow  
In time you can turn these obsessions into careers  
While the parents of those kidnapped children  
Start the bidding for their tears  
  
But I can't bring myself to look  
Wake up zombie, get yourself off the book  
You want to scream and shout my little waxen lout  
Hurry down Doomsday, the bugs are taking over  
  
Forget about Beethoven, Rembrandt and rock and roll  
Forget about Mickey Mouse, Marlboro and Coca Cola  
Forget about Cadillac, Mercedes and Toyota  
Forget about Buddha, Allah, Jesus and Jehovah  
  
Hurry down Doomsday, the bugs are taking over  
  
Any day now a giant insect mutation  
Will swoop down and devour the white man's burden  
Starting out with all of the sensitive ones  
Better make like a fly if you don't want to die  
Look out there goes Gordon  
  
But I can't bring myself to think  
Wake up zombie, kick up a big stink  
You want to scream and shout my little Saxon lout  
Hurry down Doomsday, the bugs are taking over  
  
You want to scream and shout my little Saxon lout  
Hurry down Doomsday, the bugs are taking over

191,Elvis Costello,I Almost Had A Weakness,"Thank you for the flowers  
I threw them on the fire  
And I burned the photographs that you had enclosed  
God they were ugly children  
So you're the little bastard of that brother of mine  
Trying to trick a poor old woman  
'Til I almost had a weakness  
  
Last week cousin Florence  
Bit your uncle Joe  
Hit him on the forehead with a knife and a fork  
(she) said that he looked like the devil  
Then she said...""pass the vinegar,"" I'm beginning to think  
(that) I'm the only one who hasn't taken to the drinking of it  
Though I almost had a weakness  
  
It pains me to mention  
These delicate concerns  
While I have to tolerate you family jewels  
I really mustn't grumble  
('cause) when I die the cats and dogs will jump up and down  
And you little swines will get nothing  
Though I almost had a weakness

"
192,Elvis Costello,I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down,"I'm the living result  
I'm a man who's been hurt a little too much  
And I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears  
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down  
Simple though love is  
Still it confused me  
Why I'm not loved the way I should be  
Now I've lived with heartaches  
And I've roomed with fear  
I've dealt with despair  
And I've wrestled with tears  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down  
The vow that we made  
You broke it in two  
But that don't stop me from loving you  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down

"
193,Elvis Costello,I Dreamed Of My Old Lover,"I dreamed of my old lover last night  
I wonder if I spoke out loud  
And if by chance my husband overheard  
He put my face back in the crowd  
  
His eyes were clear and gentle then  
He kissed the troubles from my brow  
I long to fall to sleep again  
And I wonder how he would look now  
  
Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?  
Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?  
I like the way it feels but then  
I rarely dream of anyone  
  
In the songs of shame and the tales of dread  
Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead  
And all the vines wind through their eyes  
Oh but no one knows this passion now  
Oh no one knows this passion now  
  
So I keep this fancy to myself  
I keep my lipstick twisted tight  
I long to fall to sleep again  
I dreamed of my old lover last night  
I long to fall to sleep again  
'Cause I dreamed of my old lover last night

"
194,Elvis Costello,I Hear A Melody (Demo),"It's easy to do, it's not so easy to say  
I was talking to you when you took my tongue away  
I hear a melody and I feel so ashamed  
I got nothing you'd need and you're so hard to blame  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and you're so hard to blame  
  
You will never work out I know that's easy to see  
So the way that I want you to stay is hidden in me  
You'll never know the fool I'm feeling tonight  
But it's best that you never know 'cause I know it's not right  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know it's not right  
  
I hear a melody, I hear a melody  
I hear a melody and I know it's not right

"
195,Elvis Costello,I Hope You're Happy Now,"He's a fine figure of a man and handsome too  
With his eyes upon the secret places he'd like to undo  
Still he knows who knows who and where and how  
And I hope you're happy now  
  
He's got all the things you need and some that you will never  
But you make him sound like frozen food, his love will last forever  
Still he knows what you want and what you don't allow  
And I hope you're happy now  
  
I hope that you're happy now like you're supposed to be  
And I know that this will hurt you more than it hurts me  
  
He's acting innocent and proud still you know what he's after  
Like a matador with his pork sword, while we all die of laughter  
In his turquoise pajamas and motorcycle hat  
I hope you're happy now because you'll soon put pay to that  
I knew then what I know now I never loved you anyhow  
And I hope you're happy now

"
196,Elvis Costello,I Still Have That Other Girl,"I have to say that we should finish it now  
Before we weaken 'cause we already know this is wrong  
I could give in, sometimes I think that I will  
Despite the temptation I try to be very strong  
In my reluctance seems a surprise  
It's not 'cause I don't want you  
  
But I just  
Know I must... Hesitate  
  
Because I still have that other girl  
In my head  
I still have that other girl in my head  
  
There may be ugly rumors that  
I have been lying  
There may be angry tears, but  
They're never worth the crying  
  
That is why  
Sometimes I... Hesitate  
  
Because I still have that other girl  
In my head  
I still have that other girl in my head  
I still have that other girl in my head

"
197,Elvis Costello,I Thought I'd Write To Juliet,"I thought I'd write to Juliet's, for she would understand  
And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down  
Instead I find myself talking to you, as my oldest friend  
Tell me how I can advise someone, that I don't even know,  
To welcome death  
  
For I received a letter that is worth reporting  
And though it may raise a cynical smile  
It leaves a sinking feeling  
Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant...  
""Have you seen my pride and joy?...""  
You know the rest...and it's no joke...forgive me please as I quote...  
""This is a letter of thanks, as I'm so bored here in I can't say where.  
So I'm writing to people that I may never meet  
And I was thinking if something you said...""  
  
""I'm a female soldier, my name is Constance.  
I enlisted in the military needing funds for college  
I'm twenty-three years old and if I do get home alive  
I imagine I may think again...""  
  
""I'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack  
Your words are a comfort, they're the best thing that I have  
Apart from family pictures and, of course, my gas mask  
I don't know why I am writing to you""

"
198,Elvis Costello,I Threw It All Away,"I once held her  
In my arms  
She said she would always stay  
But I was cruel  
And I treated her like a fool  
I threw it all away  
  
Once I had mountains  
In the palm of my hand  
And rivers to drink through everyday  
But I must have been mad  
I never knew what I had  
Until I threw it all away  
  
Love is all there is  
That makes the world go round  
Love as only love  
Can't be denied  
  
Not matter what you think about it  
Just won't be able to do without it  
Take a tip from one who's tried  
  
So when you find someone  
Who gives you all of her love  
Take it to your heart don't  
Let is stray  
'Cause one thing for certain  
You will surely be hurting  
If you throw it all away  
If you throw it all away

"
199,Elvis Costello,I Throw My Toys Around,"I've got no time for fairy stories  
I'm not a little girl  
So you can leave me all alone  
And turn off the lights as well  
If you were frightened  
Then listen:  
But I don't think you'd like it  
Such a nice kid  
  
Nobody's lookin' now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Somebody's bein' very bad  
I wonder who it can be  
Somebody's goin' to get in trouble  
I know it isn't me  
  
I'm just a little angel  
But you don't know what I've done  
When your back's turned  
Nobody's lookin' now  
I throw my toys around  
  
Pick up those building blocks  
Chop off the baby's locks  
Swing dolly by the hair  
Put down that teddy bear  
Slam dunk that happy clown  
I throw my toys around  
  
I've got no time for bedtime stories  
I'm not a little child  
Everything makes me furious  
And everything makes me wild  
  
If you were frightened  
Then whistle:  
And they'll come runnin' to you  
As you boo-hoo  
  
Nobody's looking now  
I throw my toys around  
I throw my toys around  
[repeat and fade]

"
200,Elvis Costello,I'll Wear It Proudly,"I hate these flaming curtains they're not the color of your hair  
I hate these strip lights they're not so undoing as your stare  
I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I want to do is tear  
I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down  
And nail my feet up where my head should be  
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown  
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly  
  
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm  
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm  
You have this expression dear no words could take its place  
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dance halls  
If you'll wear it proudly through the snake pits and catcalls  
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss  
If you don't know what is wrong with me  
Then you don't know what you've missed  
  
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight  
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright  
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess  
And a handful of eagerness says ""What do you suggest?""  
  
[Chorus]

"
201,Elvis Costello,I'm Your Toy,"You may be sweet and nice  
That won't keep you warm at night  
Cause I'm the one who taught you how  
To do the things you're doing now  
He may feel all your charms  
He may hold you in his arms  
But I'm the one who let you in  
I was right beside you then  
  
Once upon a time  
You let me feel you deep inside  
And nobody knew, nobody saw  
Do you remember the way you cried?  
  
I'm your toy, I'm your old boy  
But I don't want no one but you to love me  
Oh I wouldn't lie  
You know I'm not that kind of guy  
  
Once upon a time  
You let me feel you deep inside  
And nobody knew, nobody saw  
Do you remember the way you cried?  
  
I'm your toy, I'm your old boy  
But I don't want no one but you to love me  
Oh I wouldn't lie  
You know I'm not that kind of guy

"
202,Elvis Costello,Imagination,"So you're trying to make connection, you heard whispers in the hall  
She'll be out again this evening, when you come around to call  
So, you dodge the lady-killer, who came creepin' 'cross the floor  
Then you caught up in a whirlwind, you got blown right out the door  
  
Oh, yes it was a whirlwind, sweet romance was on your side  
If you wanna dance on my face, you must tell me why you lied  
  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
When you try to believe her just a little too much  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch  
  
I see a look of recognition, so well hidden in your eye  
And your peepshow regulations, they just don't seem to apply,  
Well, did I see you in the circus, in the ring without a hand  
Now you think that you can curse us, steal the show and stop the band  
  
Oh, you can follow your dreams, oh but please don't lead me on,  
If you wanna bleed in my face, you were here and now you're gone  
  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
When you try to believe her just a little too much  
Imagination is a powerful deceiver  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch  
I'll go out of my mind, if I'm losing your touch

"
203,Elvis Costello,Impatience,"How long do I have to wait?  
Before I can tell you the things I've been wanting to say  
How long must I hesitate?  
I know it makes sense but it's hard for me to stay away  
But if this is how it has to be  
Maybe it's just a feeling  
That I could name  
But I'd probably best blame...impatience  
You can't miss - what you've never known  
It's quite absurd how you started disturbing me so  
Sometimes - when I am all alone  
I lose my senses  
I have no defenses to go  
But if this is how I lose my heart  
Then I shall just embrace that  
My pulse is racing still  
I'm secretly thrilled  
By the laughter that tumbled  
And the tears that I spilled  
As far as I know no one ever got killed  
By impatience  
Tell me - is there danger still?  
I took no heed so a word might as well be deed  
Although - I'd really like to see you now  
I'm almost certain it can't be accomplished with speed  
So, if this is how I'll bide my time  
Then I will set it down  
Til we lose our caution  
I'll honor your order  
Cause it's such sweet torture  
To carry this torch  
In the light of temptation  
Beyond conversation and all expectation  
Pausing a moment or two just to mention...  
Impatience

"
204,Elvis Costello,Inch By Inch,"You can take a powder  
You can take a drink  
You can keep the shrink  
And the kitchen sink  
Write my name in heaven  
In invisible ink  
I just woke up from dreaming, I think  
  
You can take me over  
You can give me a lip  
You can take me under  
You can give me the slip  
Take off everything or tear me off a strip  
Like a lady in the chamber  
And another in the clip  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't move a muscle baby  
Don't even flinch  
You can miss me by a mile  
Or just inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
You can pull me up again  
Inch by inch  
Inch by inch  
As pulses race  
I long to see that look upon your face  
  
You can take me outside  
You can take me apart  
You can take me upstairs  
You can take me to heart  
You made me love you when  
You thought you were so smart  
Don't try to stop me when  
You told me to start  
  
[Chorus]

"
205,Elvis Costello,I've Been Wrong Before,"The night we met  
The night that I won't forget  
You've seen what I've been waiting for  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
You held me tight  
And everything seemed just right  
I couldn't ask for more  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
She used to smile at me  
And hold my hand like you do  
Then she left me  
And broke my heart in two  
  
See her face  
And feel your warm embrace  
You're all that I adore  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
Oh baby, I've been wrong before

"
206,Elvis Costello,Jack Of All Parades,"When we first met I didn't know what to do  
My old love lines were all worn out on you  
And the world walked round at my mouth  
They lit me up and they snuffed me out  
  
[Chorus]  
And I was everybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
You won't know who to thank  
You won't know who to blame  
It's just a part of the murdering game  
Cause down in the fleshpots  
Where they pay you in pounds  
They're laughing like drains  
And baying like bloodhounds  
For the Jack of all parades  
The Jack of all parades  
  
Once I knew a girl  
That looked so much like Judy Garland  
That people would stop and give her money  
And everybody was Frankie, Jimmy or Bobby  
Not the Jack, the Jack of all parades,  
Oh the Jack, the Jack of all parades,  
Oh the Jack, of all parades.  
  
Now the way that I feel is no longer news  
You know my love and how to refuse it  
Cause you know where the door is  
And how to use it  
Oh you know you do  
  
But from my checkered past  
To this shattered terrace  
Where you can't keep your mind off  
The crimes of Paris  
And you can't keep your peace  
And try to forget it  
And I can't forgive you  
For things you haven't done yet  
  
Oh I was anybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
  
When we first met I didn't know what to do  
My old love lines were all worn out on you  
And the world walked 'round my mouth  
I didn't mean to say it  
I just blurted it out  
As you pretended not to notice  
Or be taken aback  
And I loved you there and then  
It's as simple as that  
  
Oh I was everybody's boy  
But soon that thrill just fades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
To be the love of one true heart  
Or the Jack of all parades  
Oh the Jack of all parades

"
207,Elvis Costello,King Of Confidence,"She had her mind made up just like her face  
She painted in the lines and shadows  
She shaded color in that would express  
The lonely mood that follows  
Love, short and painful and tidy lies in self-defense  
She just told a thing or two to the King of Confidence  
  
You said that he could tell her anything  
She even held him when he was crying  
And made her feel she was the only one  
You knew that he was lying when he said he was lying  
  
Love is short and painful, that she finally made sense  
Of the love he had for the one and only King of Confidence  
  
It's hard enough to be your lover, let alone your confidant  
You say you know what I need but you don't know who I want  
It's just another tawdry morning now  
Another tarnished farewell  
Your body's tired and complaining now  
But you're too tore down to tell  
  
Love is short and painful, all you kind ladies and gents  
I spent years in a couple of days as the King of Confidence  
  
It's hard enough to be your lover, let alone your confidant  
You say you know what I need but you don't know who I want  
It's just another tawdry morning now  
Another tarnished farewell  
Your body's tired and complaining now  
But you're too tore down to tell  
  
Love is short and painful, all you kind ladies and gents  
I spent years in a couple of days as the King of Confidence  
I spent years in a couple of days as the King of Confidence

"
208,Elvis Costello,Less Than Zero,"Calling Mr. Oswald with the swastika tattoo  
There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo  
Carving ""V"" for ""vandal"" on the guilty boy's head  
When he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed  
To teach him he's alive before he wishes he was dead  
  
[Chorus:]  
Turn up the TV, no one listening will suspect  
Even your mother won't detect it, so your father won't know  
They think that I've got no respect but  
Everything is less than zero  
Hey, oo hey-ey  
Hey, oo hey-ey  
  
Oswald and his sister are doing it again  
They've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen  
They've got a thousand variations, every service with a smile  
They're gonna take a little break and they'll be back after a while  
Well, I hear that South America is coming into style  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
A pistol was still smoking, a man lay on the floor  
Mr. Oswald said he had an understanding with the law  
He said he heard about a couple living in the USA  
He said they traded in their baby for a Chevrolet  
Let's talk about the future, now we've put the past away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, oo hey-ey  
Hey, oo hey-ey...

"
209,Elvis Costello,Let Me Tell You About Her,"I wasn't very indiscreet and yet  
That is a notion that I might as well forget  
Friends look at me these days with fond surprise  
But when I start to speak they roll their eyes  
  
Let me tell you about her  
Hush now, I've said too much  
There's something indescribable I can't quite catch  
Let me tell you about her  
The way that she makes me feel  
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal  
  
Some things are too personal  
Too intimate to spill  
And gentlemen don't speak of them  
And this one never will  
  
I wasn't very conversational  
Accept to say that, ""You're sensational""  
Friends now regard me with indulgent smiles  
But when I start to sing they run for miles  
  
Let me tell you about her  
Hush now, I've said too much  
There's something indescribable I can't quite catch  
Let me tell you about her  
The way that she makes me feel  
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal

"
210,Elvis Costello,Let Them All Talk,"Hear what I say  
See what I do  
Believe me now I'm all over you  
All over you  
I know a place  
A certain very tender spot  
To have and to hold  
To have and have not  
Listening to the sad song that the radio plays  
Have we come this fa-fa-fa to find a soul cliche  
Let them talk  
Let them talk  
Let them all talk  
Oh yeah we're killing time  
Just to keep you clocking on  
These are the best years of your life  
Now they're here and gone  
Do the world a service  
And you could do yourself a favor  
Whose tongue now is tasting last weeks flavor  
Our day will come  
When you have squandered all your youth  
To have and to hold  
A stranger to the truth  
Listening to the sad song that the radio plays  
Have we come this fa-fa-fa to find a soul cliche  
Let them talk

"
211,Elvis Costello,Life Shrinks,"Shall I wear a buttonhole to jog your memory?  
So you'll recall the promise  
That I swore you made to me when we were younger  
You look sorry for yourself but what about?  
I'm some idea you're not without a doubt  
So you can put away that tongue  
I don't know who I'm trying to kid  
I'll find another name for you  
I'll try to put the blame on you  
For everything we did  
Life shrinks and before you know it  
You have forgotten all the cuts and bruises  
Just be thankful we were only fighting for buttons  
And you know by now who loses  
  
You're only half awake because you never go to bed  
And when he hears about it  
You know then the both of you's is dead and that's a promise  
You'll be sorry because I won't tell you again  
You'll stick like that one day  
And if you don't believe me go and ask St. Thomas  
I don't know where it's going to stop  
Spend your whole time trying to stay  
From breaking down or running away  
Or trying to keep up

"
212,Elvis Costello,Lip Service,"You left the motor running  
But I know you're so attractive  
Getting in some sharp practice  
You better not do anything reckless  
  
But everybody is going through the motions  
Everybody is going through the motions  
Are you really only going through the motions?  
  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me  
  
Don't make any sudden movements  
These are dangerous amusements  
When did you become so choosy?  
Don't act like you're above me  
Just look at your shoes  
  
But everybody is going through the motions  
Everybody is going through the motions  
Are you really only going through the motions?  
  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me  
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me  
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me  
But if you change your mind, you can send a little letter to me

"
213,Elvis Costello,Lipstick Vogue,"Don't say you love me when it's just a rumor  
Don't say a word if there is any doubt  
Sometimes I think that love is just a tumor  
You've got to cut it out  
  
You say you're sorry for the things that you've done  
You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it  
I wouldn't worry, I had so much fun  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue  
Oh yeah  
  
Get to the slot machine, almost dead on arrival  
Just hit me one more time with that live wire  
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million  
You say I've got no feelings, this is a good way to kill them  
  
Select the control and then insert the token  
You want to throw me away but I'm not broken  
You've got a lot to say--well, I'm not joking  
There are some words they don't allow to be spoken  
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being  
  
It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue

"
214,Elvis Costello,Little Palaces,"In Chocolate Town all the trains are painted brown  
On the silver paper of the wrapper  
There's a dapper little man  
And he wears a wax mustache  
That he twists with nicotine fingers  
As he drops his cigarette ash  
And someone comes and sweeps it up  
And then he doffs his cap  
And there's a rat in someone's bedroom  
And they're shutting someone's trap  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces  
  
And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present  
And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent.  
And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,  
Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,  
And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces.  
  
It's like shouting in a matchbox, filled with plasterboard and hope,  
Like a picture of Prince William in the arms of John the Pope.  
There's a world of good intentions, and pity in their eyes,  
The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize.  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,  
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.  
  
You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,  
You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable.  
To be the heir apparent, to the kingdom of the invisible.  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,  
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.

"
215,Elvis Costello,Little Savage,"I would have waited all my life  
Just to make love out of something other than spite  
But the beauty is the beast you're baiting  
Should really be worth the waiting  
  
[Chorus:]  
You do something very special to  
Mr. Average  
Now the lamb lies with the lion  
He's just a little savage  
  
And so you turn your back on me  
And all the hot air that only echoes stale tobacco  
  
Actions speak louder now than words  
By just a fraction  
What's the use of saying I love you whe I'm drinking to distraction  
We save our sanity  
By saying such and such  
After all its been discussed  
You say you must be touched  
  
[Chorus]

"
216,Elvis Costello,Little Triggers,"Little triggers that you pull with your tongue  
Little triggers, I don't want to be hung up, strung up  
When you don't call up  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggers--my hand on your hip  
  
Thinkin' all about those censored sequences  
Worryin' about the consequences  
Waiting until I come to my senses  
Better put it all in present tenses  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Worryin' about the common decency  
When it is only a question of frequency  
When you say OK but you've got cheek to be  
Sayin' you're tired of me when you don't even weaken these  
Little sniggers on your lips  
Little triggers in your grip  
Little triggers--my hand on your hip

"
217,Elvis Costello,Living In Paradise,"I don't like those other guys looking at your curves  
I don't like you walking 'round with physical jerks  
Everything they say and do is getting on my nerves  
Soon they will be lucky to be picking up the perks  
'Cause when they pull the shutters down and throw up in the dark  
They'll find that all the dogs outside bite much worse than they bark  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here we are living in paradise, living in luxury  
Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long  
You better have your fun before it moves along  
And you're already looking for another fool like me  
  
I call you Betty Felon 'cause you are a pretty villain  
And I think that I should tell them that you'd make a pretty killing  
'Cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate  
Saying, ""We always knew you'd make it, didn't think you'd come this late""  
And now it's much too dangerous to stop what you've begun  
When everyone in paradise carries a gun  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Later in the evening when arrangements are made  
I'll be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door  
'Cause I'm the first to know whenever the plans are laid  
That never go further than floor to floor  
You think that I don't know the boy that you're touching  
But I'll be at the video and I will be watching  
  
[Chorus:]

"
218,Elvis Costello,Lost In The Stars,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land  
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand  
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand  
And one little star fall alone  
  
Then the Lord God hunted through the wild night air  
For the little dark star in the wind down there  
And he stated and promised he'd take special care  
So it wouldn't get lost again  
  
Now, man don't mind if the stars grow dim  
And the clouds blow over and darken him  
So long as the Lord God's watching over him  
Keeping track how it all goes on  
  
But I've been walking through the night and the day  
Till my eyes get weary and my hair turns grey  
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away  
Forgetting the promise that we heard him say  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars  
Little stars, big stars  
Blowing through the night  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars  
Little stars, big stars  
Blowing through the night  
  
And we're lost out here in the stars

"
219,Elvis Costello,Love For Tender,"You won't take my love for tender  
You can put your money where your mouth is  
But you're so unsure  
I could be a miser or a big spender  
But you might get much more than you bargained for  
Check in on a checkmate  
Grassing on a classmate  
So beautiful and fortunate  
You're the one who hates to love  
But he's the one who loves to hate  
He can fix you all for good  
Because he is the neighbourhood  
You can get money for blood  
Blood money for doing no good  
  
Better tell me now, have you made your selection?  
Are you ready for correction?  
Cause the wages of sin are an expensive infection  
It'll make you bankrupt  
Better pay up now, don't interrupt  
So in love, I'm so sincere  
Just like a well-known financier  
You know I've never been corrupt  
  
I'll pay you a compliment  
And you'll think I am innocent  
You can total up the balance sheet  
And never know if I'm a counterfeit  
You won't take my love for tender...

"
220,Elvis Costello,Love Went Mad,"I've looked at it every way I can  
From under and above  
And every chance i've had  
My love went mad  
Love went mad love went mad  
You you feel like I feel?  
Do you have a heart?  
Do you have a heart of iron and steel?  
  
Are you a man now you wear a man's hat?  
Are you a man now or are you a rat?  
You go to church quiet as a mouse  
You're a big cheese now in the workhouse  
With these vulgar fractions of the treble clef  
I wish you luck with a capital 'f'  
A self-made mug is hard to break  
A silent partner in someone else's mistake  
  
Every day goes by without a hitch  
You feel the urge becoming an itch  
The boys in blue are hard to catch  
They're busy turning piccadilly  
Into brands hatch  
But with your fingers in your ears  
Feeling bright as a button  
Thinking 'thank god there'll be no more  
Lamb dressed as mutton'  
Playing family favorites on a tissue and a comb  
Dying a thousand deaths  
In the safety of your own home

"
221,Elvis Costello,Lover's Walk,"I won't walk with my head bowed  
(Be on) Beyond caution where lovers walk  
My love walks where three's a crowd  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers walk, lovers scramble  
Beyond caution where the lovers walk  
Lovers step, shuffle and gamble  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers trip, lovers stumble  
Lovers dip, lovers fumble  
Lovers lip where love has crumbled  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers strut, lovers stroll, lovers leap  
Lovers late, lovers wait  
Making promises that they can't keep  
Lovers link up arm and arm  
Lovers slink up, lovers charm  
Lovers drink up and come to harm  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Love is gone and it's no one's fault  
Love has stopped here, lovers halt  
Lovers don't walk, lovers run  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Now love's limping on a lover's crutch  
Looking for a hand with a personal touch  
Beyond caution where lovers walk

"
222,Elvis Costello,Luxembourg,"Dressed up like a dog's dinner  
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth  
If this is a dog's life  
Then you're the cat's clothes  
They hire out your sons  
And hire out your daughters  
The man from abroad says he's already bought her  
And now you look like a lover but you're only a tourist  
  
You're either talking or yawning  
You didn't listen to a thing you heard  
Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg  
  
You get over  
You're worried by her body  
She's worryin' about her bodily odor  
You pull off  
The pull over  
You say that you love her when you really loathe her  
Serves you right now she wants you to feed her and clothe her  
  
You're either talking or yawning  
You didn't listen to a thing you heard  
Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg  
  
They're smiling sweetly while they're looking daggers  
Kick you where it really matters  
Send all your friends to Coventry  
And look for your name in last night's obituaries  
  
If you've got the Deutschmarks  
If you've got the yen, then  
You get the shirt off her back and the clock off Big Ben  
Somebody's soft touch  
Struck all these bargains  
In the drinking clubs with the council men making  
Plans to put lead back in their pencils again  
  
You're either talking or yawning  
You didn't listen to a thing you heard  
Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg

"
223,Elvis Costello,Men Called Uncle,"Now there's newsprint all over your face  
Well maybe that's why I can read you like a book  
Just when I thought I was getting my taste to bite  
I go and lose my appetite  
Look at the men that you'd call uncle  
They'd like to sink their teeth into you  
For the pride and the pleasure  
And the privilege of having you  
  
If I say you're the one do you think that I'm serious  
You get that kind of talk from older men  
If I say I love you then I must be delirious  
So why are you trying to put my temperature up again  
  
Look at the men that you'd call uncle  
Having a heart attack round your ankles  
  
When you wake up with X-rated eyes  
When you wake up still shaking  
How can I apologize  
As you check your effects and check your reflection  
I'm so affected in the face of your affection  
  
Look at the men that you'd call uncle  
Having a heart attack round your ankles  
  
I could swear, I could promise that I'll always be true to you  
But we may not live to be so old  
I could even say I'm going to do something new to you  
Now the girls I see just leave me cold  
  
Look at the men that you call uncle...

"
224,Eurythmics,Beautiful Child,"Something that I said  
Made you wear a frown  
The way you hang your head  
Has made the tears come down  
  
But don't you wear a sigh  
My beautiful child  
  
You know it doesn't burn  
When you touch the sun  
So don't be concerned  
My golden one  
You're gonna reach the sky  
Fly  
Beautiful child  
  
There is no other place  
The human race  
Is running out of space  
There is no better love  
And human love  
Is what it takes  
  
And I'll be at your side  
When you're falling down  
You'll be feeling fine  
When you hit the ground  
So don't slip away  
Stay  
Beautiful child

"
225,Eurythmics,Brand New Day,"Six o'clock in the morning  
And I'm stepping through the streets  
The pavement's cold and empty  
Got the blues beneath my feet.  
Big old sun is rising up  
So elegant and thin  
Another day is over  
So a new day will begin  
And the word said hey  
It's a brand new day  
  
Oh baby baby baby  
I dreamed about you  
Please tell me tell me tell me  
What I've seen could not be true  
You have taken my existance  
You have filled it full of stones  
You have turned into a stranger  
Now I need to walk alone  
  
But I won't be sad  
But I won't be destroyed  
  
And the word said  
Hey it's a brand new day.

226,Eurythmics,Conditional Soul,"(When will you make up your mind?)  
Darling just be yourself tonight.  
There's nothing wrong with the way you feel.  
The moon and stars are in the sky.  
We're centuries apart  
And the lights are shining down on you.  
(I can't stand it)  
Everybody's kissing someone.  
Holding hands just to get some fun.  
I couldn't care less if I ever get none.  
Or never fall into some lover's arms again.  
(I can't stand it)  
Aah... Conditioned soul  
When will you make up your mind?  
(I can't stand it)  
Aah... Conditioned soul  
When will you make up your mind?  
(I can't stand it)  
Darling don't be afraid tonight.  
Something's wrong with the way you feel.  
The moon and stars have all gone by.  
We're centuries apart and the lights are dying.  
Everybody's hurting someone.  
Stabbing back just to get some fun.  
I hope to God I don't get me none.  
Or never fall into some killer's arms again.  
When will you make up your mind?  
(I can't stand it)

227,Eurythmics,Damien Save Me,"Damien save me  
And be my guide  
Sooner or later  
We're all gonna die  
When we were walking  
Through the streets  
Everything you said was bittersweet  
And I wish that we could be in a  
Bottle of time just you and me  
Let's talk about the ways and means  
The body shape  
The love supreme  
And drink drink until we disappear  
Damien save me  
And be my god  
Sooner or later  
I'm gonna die like a dog  
Cut me in half  
And I'll let you see  
What this whole wide world  
Has done to me  
I'll be you sacrificial cow  
Just tell me when and I'll  
Show you how  
Let's talk about  
The sacrifice  
The body limbs  
That rest on ice and drink drink until  
We disappear  
I know you'll never let me down  
Down down down  
So let's take it and push it  
And kick it and break it  
And turn it all around.  
Damien save me  
And be my guy  
Sooner or later  
We're all gonna die  
When we were walking  
Through the streets  
Everything you said was bittersweet  
And I wish that we could be  
In a bottle of time  
Just you and me  
When we were walking through the streets  
...walking through the streets  
...walking through the streets.

228,Eurythmics,Even The Bad Times (were Good Times),"I lost my grip  
Began to fall  
On the way down  
Made one last call  
You wanted me and him besides  
I laughed so much  
I nearly died  
  
Even the bad times were good times  
Even the bad times were alright  
Maybe you wanted the good times  
Maybe the bad times were all you could find  
  
I went to sleep  
To grind my teeth  
No mirror ball  
Faulty T. V..  
I felt my coat  
Around my throat  
I couldn't sing  
Another note  
  
Sometimes it's tough  
Sometimes it's rough  
No matter what you got  
You can't get enough  
  
Even the bad times were good times  
Even the bad times were alright  
Maybe you wanted the good times  
Maybe the bad times were all you could find  
  
I worshipped you  
You know it's true  
I worshipped you  
What else could I do  
  
Even the bad times were good times  
Even the bad times were alright

229,Eurythmics,Fashion Bomb,"I know her footsteps like the back of my hand  
I heard her coming though she was walking on sand  
I could smell her perfume from a 1,000 smiles away  
Stuck in my head yeah it stuck in my brain  
She looked so good and I thought she could have been  
A fashion bomb a fashion bomb  
Looked so nervous she look so afraid  
Looked like somebody had just stepped on her grave  
Last night at the control centre  
She lost c-c-c-complet control (oh no)  
She lost her mind now she's one of a kind  
A fashion bomb a fashion bomb  
She's radio active you can see it in her eyes  
Radioactive from her hips to her thighs  
Radioactive she could kill you with one kiss  
Radioactive she said what do you think of this  
I'm such a big girl and I'm gonna show the world  
I'm a fashion bomb a fashion bomb  
I work all day and l work all night  
I sleep on corners where vampires bite  
My place is riddled with machine gun fire  
But I stlll look pretty and my body's for hire  
Say a goodbye to Joni from the real world  
Say goodbye to Mary she's such a stupid girl  
She knows what's coming but she's got no defense  
She just can't stop it though it doesn't make no sense  
Here comes the bitch she's much too rich to be a fashion bomb...  
Ad libs to fade

230,Eurythmics,For The Love Of Big Brother,"Like a train passing in the distance  
Black bird in flight, I hear you call  
And even though there's no one  
Dark shadows move across the wall  
I still hear the echo  
Of your footsteps on the stairs  
Still recall the images that  
Seem to live out there  
First you see my fingerprints  
Like skeletons of leaves on the wall  
People changing places  
I stand for a moment and it's gone  
I still hear the echo  
Of your footsteps on the stairs  
Still recall the images that  
Seem to live out there  
Like a train passing in the distance  
Black bird in flight I hear you call  
And even though there's no one  
Dark shadows move across the wall  
I still hear the sound of  
Conversations from the hall  
Look to see who's coming  
But it's nothing and there's no one there at all  
No one there at all, no one there at all  
No one there at all, no one there at all

Pickin' all the flowers from the cemetery park  
I didn't know anybody could be so dark as her  
Here she comes that girl with the vampire grin  
Looking for a victim to take her in  
Brothers in bloods sisters in sin love her  
She said

Cause Baby with you

I can be so free  
Here she comes that girl with the bloodstained dress  
Shot gun humour laden acid test

She could eat the rest just like that  
Here she comes that girl with the wicked smile  
Beatin' on a pony up a crooked mile  
You should see her listen to voodoo child on her back  
She said

How can you be so cold  
With my arms to enfold you?  
  
I could give you - a mirror  
To show you - dissappointments  
I could give you - a history  
Could you ever listen in to me?  
  
How can you be so cold  
When there's a fire burning?  
How can you be so cold  
When all the ice is melting?

To show you - dissappointments  
I could give you - a history  
Could you ever listen in to me?

234,Eurythmics,I Remember You,"Well there's a color picture  
In my mind.  
Of all the places  
That I've left behind.  
The broken windows  
Where the wind blows through  
Empty shells of houses  
That have turned to ruin.  
  
Oh, we were so young.  
We didn't realise  
Just what we'd done.  
Oh, we were too young.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I remember you.  
You were the back yard boy.  
Hiding in the wreckage  
Of broken dreams.  
Standing by the railway line.  
Standing.  
  
Oh, we were so young.  
We didn't realise  
Just what we'd done.  
Oh, we were too young.  
  
And all the sweetness  
Has been taken out of this place.  
So many memories  
Are knocked down or replaced.  
And I can't stand to see  
The shifting time  
Taking me further,  
Leaving you behind.  
  
[Chorus]

There's a photograph  
Hanging on my wall  
Of a place I've never been to  
  
I'll never make the grade  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
And I can't stop the rain  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
What do the papers say?  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
Get up and go now!  
  
[Chorus:]  
In this town, something's gotta change.  
In this town, something's gotta change.  
  
I'm looking at the world,  
Looking for a scene,  
Waiting for a day,  
Filling in time like I'm digging  
My own grave  
  
I'll never make the grade  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
And I can't stop the rain  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
What do the papers say?  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
Get up and go now!

238,Eurythmics,Leaving This Earth (again),"She takes a shower in a small town  
Near Birmingham  
Though here clothes are  
Unfashionable  
They have a timeless feel  
Is she real?  
  
She leaves the building  
And walks through  
The housing estate  
It's 7.30  
A state grey sky  
But in spite of this  
She turns and blows a kiss  
  
She's leaving this earth again  
There's a shuttle bound for take off  
11.45 a.m. she'll be there  
She's special  
Oh so special  
Knows enough about science  
To get married to a millionaire  
She'll be there  
  
He'll comb his hair  
In a high rise apartment  
On the river Tyne  
Though his neck is scarred  
He has a strong and handsome face  
A human face  
He leaves the building  
And walks to his electric car  
It's 7.30 there's a bitter wind  
But in spite of that  
He turns and tips his hat  
  
He's leaving this earth again  
There's a shuttle bound for take off  
11.45 a.m.  
  
He'll be there  
He's so special oh so special  
Knows enough about science  
To forget about his morning prayers  
He'll be there  
  
I'm leaving this earth again  
There's a shuttle bound for take off  
11.45 a.m. I'll be there  
I'm special oh so special  
I was chosen by the captain  
Of a spaceship in Trafalgar Square  
And I promised I'd be there or be square!

"
239,Eurythmics,Let's Go!,"He was the kinda guy  
I liked the way he looked.  
He had a red silk tie,  
He had a forties suit.  
  
And I said, ""You're the kind of person  
I've been longing to adore.""  
""You're the kind of person  
I've been waiting for.""  
  
He said, ""The time is right to take a chance  
'Cause I'm looking for a brand new romance.""  
""So come on baby let's go outside -  
I've got a car in the drive and we can take a ride.""  
""So let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo.""  
""Let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo.""  
  
Well, we went driving for an hour or so  
Till we took the little Chevy down to Mexico.  
And I said, ""Blue eyed boy, you know I love the way you look.""  
  
""Why don't we find a preacher  
Who can get us hooked?""  
""You know the time is right to take a chance  
'Cause I'm looking for a brand new romance.""  
And the great big moon  
Was a shinin' down  
He said ""Forget about the preacher man,  
Let's do it on the ground!""  
  
""Let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo.""  
""Let's go, I want to fall in love ooh hoo.""

240,Eurythmics,Lifted,"Don't be afraid when you  
Walk through the dark  
Just when you feel that  
Your day fell apart  
Stay strong  
Keep holding on  
Clear skies ahead and the dark day is done  
Keep on lifted  
Keep on lifted  
  
I wish you everything  
That you could want  
Just when the day finds you  
Turned back to front  
Stay clear  
Rescue is near  
When you feel  
That you're drowned in despair  
Keep on lifted  
Keep on lifted  
  
You're a bird in the sky now baby  
Earthbound  
Feet on the ground  
Now you can find peace at last  
Now you can find peace at last

"
241,Eurythmics,Little Bird,"I look up to the little bird  
That glides across the sky  
He sings the clearest melody  
It makes me want to cry  
I makes me want to sit down  
And cry cry cry  
I walk along the city streets  
So dark with rage and fear  
And I...  
I wish that I could be that bird  
And fly away from here  
I wish I had the wings to fly away from here  
But my my I feel so low  
My my where do I go?  
My my what do I know?  
My my we reap what we sow  
They always said that you knew best  
But this little bird's fallen out of that nest now  
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed  
So I've just got to put these wings to test  
For I am just troubled soul  
Who's weighted...  
Weighted to the ground  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Till I can lay this burden down  
Give me the strength to lay this burden down down down yea  
Give me the strength to lay it down  
But my my I feel so low  
My my where do I go?  
My my what do I know?  
My my we reap what we sow  
They always said that you knew best  
But this little bird's fallen out of that nest now  
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed

"
242,Eurythmics,Love Is A Stranger,"Love is a stranger  
In an open car  
To tempt you in  
And drive you far away  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I want you  
And I want you  
And I want you so  
It's an obsession  
  
Love is a danger  
Of a different kind  
To take you away  
And leave you far behind  
And love love love  
Is a dangerous drug  
You have to receive it  
And you still can't  
Get enough of the stuff  
  
It's savage and it's cruel  
And it shines like destruction  
Comes in like the flood  
And it seems like religion  
It's noble and it's brutal  
It distorts and deranges  
And it wrenches you up  
And you're left like a zombie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's guilt edged  
Glamorous and sleek by design  
You know it's jealous by nature  
False and unkind  
It's hard and restrained  
And it's totally cool  
It touches and it teases  
As you stumble in the debris  
  
[Chorus]

"
243,Eurythmics,Love Shines,"Disappointed, on a cold and weary day  
All the little angels have all left and gone away  
Crystal is the water thaf's running down your face  
Is pale just like the moonlight on the sad and lonely place  
Broken hearted and with reason to be  
A cruel and twisted blow from whichever way you see  
Man was make to suffer and a woman left to grieve  
It makes it hard for even the strongest to believe  
Love shines on everything  
Love shines on you  
Love shines on every little thing  
Circumstances have led us to the edge  
Broken our wings and given us minds to think instead  
With the sky above us and the black old earth below  
We're all left there stranded with but there's one thing we must know  
That is  
Love shines on everything  
Love shines on you  
Love shines on every little thing  
Broken hearted on the planet of decay  
Watching Mother Nature just choke and died away  
Man has made a prison from a place called paradise  
And you could be the jailer if you don't think twice  
And let all  
Love shine on everyone  
Let it shine on you  
Let it shine on every little thing  
Love shines on everything  
Love shines on you  
Love shines on every little thing  
Every little thing you do

Whistling my consence to make me cry

Desire, despair, desire  
So many monsters  
  
Oh, but now

Whistling my consence to make me cry

But we will only come  
And you know what mommy?  
Everybody was being real crazy  
The monsters are crazy.  
There are monsters outside

Nothing alas alack  
Nowhere to go but out out out  
Nowhere to come but back

They're handing out lollipops  
Progress would be wonderful  
If only it would stop  
  
No bees no honey no work no money  
  
Nothing to do but think think think  
Nothing alas alack  
Nowhere to go for a drink drink drink  
Nowhere to come but back

246,Eurythmics,"Oh No, Not You Again","Oh no, not you again  
I paid you already  
Too much times ten  
Oh no, not you again  
I don't know how it started  
But this is the end  
There's a gap in your teeth  
The words fall through  
They spread a virus  
And they stick like glue  
There's a pain in my neck  
And a stone in my shoe  
There's a lump in my throat  
It was more than I could chew  
Oh no, not you again  
With your cheque book religion  
And your diet coke friends  
Oh no, not you again  
There's a hole in your foot  
You shot it yourself  
Pulled the silver trigger  
And damaged your health  
I've been dying from exposure  
Since I shook your hand  
I see California gave you more than a tan  
Oh no, not you again  
With your world in a bubble  
And your gossamer smile  
Oh no, not you again  
So nice to hear from you  
Once in a while  
You stuck a knife  
In my back  
And my blood ran cold  
I think you mistook  
Me for a bag of gold  
But there's justice in  
The valley and they  
Say it's divine  
I've heard all about  
Your problems  
Now here's some of mine.

Perfect teeth behind velvet lips

When the sun went down it went down on me  
On fire now I'm on fire  
On fire now I'm on fire  
All over all over yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm the jack of hearts (he's the jack of hearts)

With your perfect teeth behind your velvet lips

248,Eurythmics,Out Of Reach,"Jerry got ready with her boots and furs  
Put a wig on her head and stumbled down the stairs  
Fell into the back of a limousine  
Nobody would have I guessed she was a beauty queen  
Out of reach, out of touch, out of time  
Out of luck, out of loves, out of her mind  
Madame George got played today  
She almost forgot she could feel that way  
Information coming from north and south  
She could barely get the words out of her mouth  
Out of reach, out of touch, out of time  
Out of luck, out of love, out of her mind  
Play the plastic guitar  
Now Jerry's on the verge of a major breakthrough  
She's gonna stop lying, gonna tell the truth  
She made it with a major in the Lincoln Hotel  
And nobody knows why she gets treated so well  
Out of reach, out of touch, out of lime  
Out of luck, out of love, out of her mind

Corridors of mirrors in a never ending night  
Jukebox electric shining in your face  
Arms like a gorilla playing a stumbling bass  
You were singing under water when you started to drown  
I never did like you much so I didn't slick around  
Matthew was the only one who lasted till the end  
He was swimming in the kitchen when his mind began to bend  
In party town, party down  
I saw you with your dress torn down  
In party town, party down  
You were naked and alone  
Officers and criminals were walking hand in hand  
The king of executioners he was singing in the band  
Microscopes and laser beams they all were being used  
Girls were drinking novocaine to keep themselves amused  
Senators and ministers were hanging in the sky  
People paying in advance to watch the scene go by  
Magazines were quoting all the things that had been said  
Making fun and money on the fact that she was dead  
Party girl, party girl, I saw you in your party world  
Party girl, party girl, you were naked and alone instrumental... Party  
Party town, party town, where the beat goes down  
Party town, party town, you can hear them beg for more

254,Eurythmics,She,"She maybe the face I can't forget  
A trace of pleasure or regret  
Maybe my treasure or the price I have to pay  
She maybe the song that summer sings  
Maybe the chill that autumn brings  
Maybe a hundred different things  
Maybe the measure of a day  
  
She maybe the beauty or the beast  
Maybe the famine or the feast  
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell  
She maybe the mirror of my dream  
A smile reflected in a stream  
She may not be what she may seem  
Inside her shell  
  
She who always seems so happy in a crowd  
Who's eyes can be so private and so proud  
No one's allowed to see them when they cry  
She maybe the love that cannot last  
May come from shadows of the past  
That I remember until the day I die  
  
She maybe the reason I survive  
The why and wherefore I'm alive  
The one I care for through the rough  
Me, I take her laughter and her tears  
And make them all my souvenirs  
For where she goes I've got to be  
The meaning of my life is she

It took a little time  
But you calmed me down  
Some people never say the words ""I love you""  
It's not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words ""I love you""  
But like a child They're longing to be told  
They've got a wall in China  
It's a thousand miles long  
To keep out the foreigners  
They made it strong  
And I've got a wall around me  
That you can't even see  
It took a little time  
To get next to me  
If something goes wrong  
I'm the first to admit it  
The first to admit it  
But the last one to know  
If something goes right  
Well,it's likely to lose me  
It's apt to confuse me  
Because it's such an unusual sight  
Oh I can't get used to something so right  
Something so right  
Some people never say the words ""I love you""  
It's not their style to be so bold  
Some people never say the words ""I love you""

Stays on the ashtray  
And fingernails

Program crashing  
Disenchanted  
I hope nobody tries to get in my way

Faces frozen

With cigarette papers  
No compassion  
Just a companion

A casserole empty  
No connection

But there's just one thing

And I really wanna know  
  
Who's that girl  
Running around with you?  
Tell me  
Who's that girl  
Running around with you?  
  
The language of love

Tongue tied and twisted  
At the price I've had to pay  
Your careless notions  
Have silenced these emotions  
Look at all the foolishness  
Your lover's talk has done

When it came to the test  
Wow oh  
  
She was a cut above the rest.  
She was a wide eyed girl  
With teased up hair  
She could have had money  
But she didn't care  
She was looking for you daddy  
  
Never there  
Looking for you daddy oh yea yea  
  
Wide eyed girl  
  
She was a wide eyed girl  
Of a tender age.  
Just moving out of her sensitive phase.  
She said  
""I love you baby it's for always  
And I don't care what the teacher says.""  
When she walked out  
Through the streets of Rome.  
All of the Italians wanna take her home  
All the brown little babies  
With the slicked back hair  
Sayin' ""Prima amore, wow!""  
  
""I'm sayin' something  
Are ya listening to me?""  
""Don't you walk away when I'm  
Communicating with you!""  
""She's goin' clickin' clackin'  
Down the road in them high heeled shoes""!  
""Mona Lisa!!!""

259,Eurythmics,Wise Guy,"Leave my face down beneath the sun  
I'll get a better view of what's going on  
Let me do the things that I do best  
In a state of humble gratefulness  
This must be where I belong  
The ice-cream king is playing my song  
To a girl with a teenage clothing dilemma  
Who says  
Let me kiss your lips  
  
If you smile with the wise  
You get a key to an open sky  
If you smile with the wise  
You get to see your name in neon lights  
  
Lead me into unknown pleasures  
Save your lying for the needy  
Give me something good to treasure  
As I bite the hands that feed me  
Suffer  
Suffocate in wisdom  
Read a book then smash the system  
Free and foolish call it clever  
I'm the one and only  
Go-go getter  
  
If you smile with the wise  
You get a key to an open sky  
If you smile with the wise  
You get to see your name in neon lights

You can cry  
But you can't look me  
Look me in the eye  
You're lost forever  
You can walk  
Yes you can run  
But you'll never be number one  
You're lost forever  
There's a church bell ringing  
On a mountain top  
You'll never hear it if you don't stop  
Big bird flying in a clear blue sky  
Don't it make you stop to think  
And wonder why...  
You may lose  
You may win  
But I'll never talk to you again  
You're lost forever

262,Gary Numan,A Prayer For The Unborn,"So, I prayed...  
But you weren't listening.  
Making miracles?  
So, I begged...  
But you were far away.  
Saving souls perhaps?  
So, I screamed...  
But she was very small  
And you have worlds to mend.  
So, she died...  
And you were glorious.  
But you were somewhere else.  
If you are my shepherd  
Then I'm lost and no one can find me.  
If you are my saviour  
Then I'm dead and no one can help me.  
If you are my glory  
Then I'm sick and no one can cure me.  
If you light my darkness  
Then I'm blind and no one can see me.  
If you are my father  
Then love lies abandoned and bleeding.  
If you are my comfort  
Then nightmares are real and deceiving.  
If you are my answer  
Then I must have asked the wrong question.  
I'd spit on your heaven  
If I could find one to believe in.

Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Cold metal voice  
Of no one's friend it could be mine  
My reflection  
Is no longer me at all  
Am I a fake  
Of the man and are you of me  
Are you real?  
  
Is it me, is it you  
Relax in a backroom  
Oh me oh my oh wouldn't you

Do you want to come  
Do you want to come with me now  
  
Nothing here for me now  
I can't believe the noise  
We'll take this place apart  
I won't be here for long

268,Gary Numan,Bleed,"Someone is talking  
But it's not conversation,  
Sounds more like a voice in my head.  
It says  
'I live in nightmares  
I'm the new god of panic  
And I'm waiting for you to come home to me.  
  
'So boy, welcome to sleep  
I'm gonna make you, make you, make you bleed.'  
  
I could be dreaming  
But then maybe that's fatal.  
There's nowhere to hide in your dreams.  
I'm so uneasy  
I'm shaking and nervous.  
I'm alone in my room and I'm scared of it.  
  
So, don't let me sleep  
It's gonna make me, make me, make me bleed.  
  
My mother told me  
'Don't believe in ghost stories.  
There's nothing to hurt you in here.'  
But she was wrong  
And now it's come back to haunt me.  
It says it won't leave me alive for long.  
  
I don't want to sleep.  
It's gonna make me, make me, make me bleed.

269,Gary Numan,Blind,"I Put my fear back in its box  
And I Put the box where love is blind  
And I walk in the dark  
Where pain waits smiling  
And I know that I can't leave  
I look at what I've become  
I'm a pure and perfect lie  
Like a blind man falling  
Scared and helpless  
And I'm still falling from grace  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded  
I don't know why I'm afraid  
I don't know why I'm unsure  
And if it all comes down to  
What I'm feeling  
I don't know what I can say  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded  
I stumble  
In the depths of my sin  
On my knees  
I'm a sick man drowning  
I belong  
But for you it's down to  
Who you know  
And do you need this?  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded

270,Gary Numan,Blue Eyes,"Well you're pretty quick to say you love me  
But I've met your kind before  
So I took you twice on our first night  
That doesn't mean I'm going to trust you too far  
  
Love your blue eyes  
When you cry  
Love your blue eyes  
  
You tried to make me crawl far too soon  
But you should know me better by now  
I didn't even feel like trying with you  
I knew that I could break you somehow

When you cry  
Love your blue eyes

I see a policeman crying in the backseat of a dying Ford  
Hotel waiters leave the bedrooms of stars  
Who are far too old  
And no-one ever told me  
That I could be so cold  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero  
  
I see an old man knocked to the ground  
And beaten by the vicar's wife  
No-one stops to help they're far too busy  
Trying to save their own lives  
A tiny girl screams for mother  
And wanders out into the street  
I saw her going down underneath  
A thousand people's running feet  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero  
  
All the junkies pulling needles from their arms  
Hope it lasts all night  
And all the soldiers curse the day they joined the army  
And prepare to fight  
In silent bars, in silent rooms, in silent cars  
You hide where you can  
And me I know just where you are, you see  
I'm a bomber man  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero

272,Gary Numan,Conversation,"Oh it's so easy  
When parts take over  
My conversation  
Is nothing more than lies  
  
You're just the viewer  
So cold and distant  
I've no intentions  
Of saying I love you  
  
My conversation  
  
We are not gods  
We are not men  
We are not making claims  
We are only boys  
  
You are not strong  
You are not force  
You are not regular  
You are just wrong  
  
There are no faces  
This is my complex  
You are my picture  
I call you 'mirrors'  
  
These are not my tears  
Not my reflection  
Am I a photo?  
I can't remember

I hear Jesus crying  
In my darkness  
I see children savage and blind  
In my darkness  
I see dead men kneel before the cross  
In my darkness  
I hear the voice of evil  
  
Disciples, dark angels  
This is dominion day  
'My demons, come to me  
This is dominion day'  
  
In his darkness  
I can feel the storm come  
In his darkness  
Holy water burns my soul  
In his darkness  
A grave waits for you at heaven's gate  
In his darkness  
I hear screams that hide the voice of God  
  
'Come children of Eden  
Pray to me on dominion day'  
'Pray for your salvation  
Sanctuary on dominion day'  
My soul save me  
  
In his mercy  
He will bring the disease  
In his mercy  
He will burn the oceans  
In his mercy  
He will tear the sky down  
In his mercy  
He will make pain eternal  
  
'Your nightmare is breathing  
This is dominion day'  
Welcome to your saviour  
This is dominion day  
'This is my new kingdom  
This is dominion day'  
'Creation bleeds for me  
This is dominion day'

Where the machmen  
Meet the machines  
And play 'Kill by numbers'  
Down in the park  
With a friend called 'Five'  
  
I was in a car crash  
Or was it the war  
But I've never been  
Quite the same  
Little white lies  
Like 'I was there'  
  
Come to 'Zom Zoms'  
A place to eat  
Like it was built  
In one day  
You can watch the humans  
Trying to run  
  
Oh look  
There's a rape machine  
I'd go outside  
If it looked the other way  
You wouldn't believe  
The things they do  
  
Down in the park  
Where the chant is  
'Death, death, death'  
Until the sun cries morning  
Down in the park  
With friends of mine  
  
We are not lovers  
We are not romantics  
'We are here to serve you'  
A different face  
But the words never change

275,Gary Numan,Dream Killer,"So I've seen my future  
And I've seen dream killers  
And I've seen you everytime.  
So I've heard opinions  
And I've heard dark rumours  
And I've heard you everytime.  
You hurt my feelings  
You hurt my family  
You hurt my reasons to try  
I can't forgive you  
I will remember  
I'll pay you back one cold day.  
So I've seen my weakness  
And I've seen my heart break  
And I've seen you everytime.  
So I've heard promises  
And I've heard every lie  
And I've heard you everytime.  
You lied to father  
You lied to mother  
You lied to brother and me  
I used to dream, now  
I forget how to  
So should I learn how to lie?  
You take my picture  
You take my ghosts and laugh  
You take my reason  
You take my soul away.  
You take my heartbeat  
You take my innocence  
You take my dreams and  
You'll take my life away.  
So now I'm old news  
And you would change me  
But I'm so tired of this  
There is no comfort  
In fame when it dies  
And I'm so tired of it.

One answer

One lie  
Too much  
I've heard it all before  
I need emotion

You're gonna make me feel so cold  
  
See my one love talking to the pretty boy  
I never did like her taste  
My skin is rubber on a skeletal body  
I'm physically going to waste  
Feel my eyes and the tongue of a killer  
I'm a humanoid logic machine  
Don't touch me with your painted little fingers  
'Cause I know where they've been  
You're not gonna put those scabs on me  
  
I must hide from a thousand grinning faces  
All sucking from my crazy mind  
Take a ride out in my imagery of ages  
And heaven knows what you will find  
I've no time for the chitter-chatter ladies  
I'm so busy trying to break this wall  
Hear my words 'cause emotion now is leaving  
You see I'm really not a human at all  
And I don't think I want to stay

Was justified?  
You think it's you  
Who hasn't had  
A secret need  
A truth to hide  
Desires to feed?  
You think it's you  
Who has the strength  
To save us all  
To make us clean  
And break our fall?  
You think It's You  
Does God bleed on the word?  
Does God bleed on your white halo?  
I looked inside  
A big mistake  
I'd make it stop  
But it's too late.  
I Think It's You  
I've never been  
Afraid to face  
A fear but there's  
No darker place  
I Think than You.  
Something crawls  
And something lies  
Something breathes  
And something dies.  
I think it's you  
Does God bleed on the word?  
Does God bleed on your white halo?

Looked like... black and white movies  
No light

She said

""Can you feel me?  
I'm the new disease  
I'm like a hunger  
That you've never known""  
""Do you want me?  
I'll take everything  
I'm like a hunger  
Lying in your heart""  
He made excuses  
Tried to leave the room  
She said  
""I'm the disease and the cure  
Skin mechanics  
Couldn't help you here  
The nature of need  
Leaves you junk sick and lonely""  
""Trick it up  
Trick it up good""  
She moved  
Like a ghost to the door

And walked in on it all  
She said  
""You could be here forever""

And I die : You die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die : You die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me, tear me, tear me  
  
But I have your names  
Screaming 'You will suffer'  
And, 'You're all too late'  
Now I feel young  
Does everything stop when the old tape fails?  
  
They crawl out of their holes for me  
And I die, you die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die, you die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me, tear me, tear me  
  
But I'm still frightened by the telephone.

We went to sleep by dialing 'o'  
We drove to work by proxy  
I plugged my wife in, just for show  
  
New ways, new ways  
I dream of wires  
  
So I press 'c' for comfort  
I dream of wires, the old days

"
284,Gary Numan,I Still Remember,"So you've gone  
Singing some old love song  
I've nothing more to lose  
  
I'm surrounded  
By old stories  
With nowhere to hide  
  
I could tear  
All your pictures  
I could tear everything  
  
You told me  
Time makes it easy but you  
Never told me time stands still  
  
I can't believe it  
I can't believe how it hurts  
I can't believe it  
I can't believe how love burns away  
  
I remember  
  
I can't sleep  
All your words  
Seem to let me down  
  
Where are you  
Why don't you call  
It's been a long long time  
  
I still remember  
I still remember it all  
I still remember  
I still remember how love burned away  
  
This could be  
My last song  
Everything must end some day  
  

"
285,Gary Numan,Ice,"I'm playing at ice  
But I'm finding it hard  
She didn't break the wall  
She just caught me off guard  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
I'm just a little bit sorry  
But I haven't decided why  
Could it be my memory  
Or did I ever really cry  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
Fill my head with your false feelings  
I can't trust anything you say  
Today I missed a special friend  
That never really cared anyway  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  

"
286,Gary Numan,I'm On Automatic,"This is metal rhythm  
A new song on the Radio  
Some new face  
A picture on your wall  
Talk to me  
You say it's nothing personal  
But somethings wrong  
It's eating me alive  
I can't fine the reason  
So I can't find the cure  
They say nothings's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
I've never hurt like this  
I'm On Automatic  
I've heard it all before  
Some new flavour  
With nothing in the hear  
This isn't music  
This is survival  
But I'm still here  
Now isn't that strange  
I can't find the reason  
So I can't find the cure  
They say nothing's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
I've never hurt like this  
They say nothing's wrong forever  
But that somethings wrong with me  
Oh I've been down so far  
Nothing's ever hurt like this  

"
287,Gary Numan,In A Dark Place,"Something calls me  
From a dark place  
And so I pray every night  
Something knows me  
It whispers my name  
And I'm losing my faith  
I can feel it breathing  
But it feels like something dead and cold  
I can feel it waiting  
But it waits for something in my soul  
Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid  
So I beg God  
For salvation, for an angel  
Every night  
And I ask God  
Can He forgive me?  
And I want to believe  
I think I hear it laughing  
But it sounds like my voice lost and old  
I think it showed me Heaven  
And now I know why I'm scared to die  
Am I a fool in the dark, I don't know  
Am I the ghost in my dreams, I don't know  
Am I a shadow of life, I don't know  
Am I afraid of the truth, I don't know  
Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid  
So I ask for  
One small mercy?  
But it whispers 'Who are you?'  
So I ask God  
If He can save me?  
He says 'It's all too dark'

"
288,Gary Numan,Innocence Bleeding,"Do you believe in Heaven?  
That man's soul is eternal?  
Our prayers are always answered?  
And miracles can happen?  
  
Save me.  
  
But don't you wonder?  
The Holy Ghost and Jesus?  
In paradise and angels?  
That God is all forgiving?  
  
Save me.  
  
Reward the faithful?  
He lies to you and deceives.  
A dark salvation comes.  
Innocence bleeding.  
  
Too dark to see the pictures of Heaven  
Too dark to find the Garden of Eden.  
Blinded by faith and stories of wonder,  
Devine mercy? Mercy lies bleeding.  
  
Save me.

"
289,Gary Numan,Jo The Waiter,"Jo the waiter worked for me  
Serving wine in basement bars  
Only mad men ever stay. 'got no time'  
If your mindless please take mine  
  
Jo the waiter held me close  
Behind the door marked 'gentlemen'  
Just for now that's all I need  
Won't someone call me 'friend'  
Long gone. I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
  
We burned out and the line went dead  
At six o'clock I felt so alone  
I crawled inside. 'where else to go'?  
Could be dead for all you know  
Everyday I died for you  
Valium boys with painted eyes  
Young man need love special  
I don't think I want it at all  
  
Long gone. I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
Me I retired to a back street flat  
Picture 'eyes in a cold steel frame'  
The freaks arrive.  
Broken needles and blood  
'What you on man to get those eyes'  
  
It's very touching I'm so close to me  
False smiles I've rehearsed for days  
Come inside you won't know I'm wrong  
Give me your heart I'm so quickly gone

"
290,Gary Numan,Like A Refugee,"Treated like a refugee  
Never seems to be a place for me  
In my mind there is a scene i see  
My house is burning  
No-one returning  
To a land once free.  
  
Dreaming like a deportee  
Cast away upon the open sea  
No hand of friendship for the likes of me.  
I feel the thunder  
I'm going under  
And i can't get free.  
  
If there is a heaven  
I don't want to hang around this hell.  
I could be an angel  
Let god (slip? )out of heaven back to hell.  
  
And i say  
I wont cry, no more tears  
I wont cry, no more tears  
  
Carry me away from here  
Cut the crying and the see-through tear  
Make emotion dissappear  
My life is changing  
I'm re-arranging  
Everything i feel.

"
291,Gary Numan,Love Is Like Clock Law,"This heart is empty  
I've barely hidden memories  
I've found a picture that haunts me again  
  
I've no sad expression  
I've no tears in my eyes  
But I am the clown who forgot how to laugh  
  
I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name?  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
  
Love is like clock law  
Tick tock my heartbeat  
I was a passion that passed her spare time  
  
This room is prison  
Love doesn't come here  
These quiet nights will slowly kill me  
  
I wonder, does she think of me?  
I wonder, I wonder  
I wonder, does she call my name  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me here alone  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
Don't leave me, don't leave me  
I cried  
Don't leave me, don't leave me here  
I'm quite alone  

"
292,Gary Numan,Love Isolation,"These are words  
Just for you  
Only words  
But it's all I can do  
  
Reasons fade  
As reasons can do  
All I want  
Is to talk with you  
  
You cried with me  
Laughed at me  
Talked to me  
Sheltered me  
Fought by me  
Lied for me  
You lived for me  
  
So call me  
And I'll run to you  
Ask me  
And I'd die for you  
  
You were there  
You were always there  
Like a friend  
Like a lifelong friend  
And I love you  
  
I broke your heart  
And you stole mine  
Memories lie  
But they're all I can find  
  
Call my name  
Sing my song  
Call for me  
I've been waiting so long  
  
Just call me  
And I'll run to you  
Ask me  
And I'd die for you  
  
You were there  
You were always there  
Like a friend  
Like a lifelong friend  
And I miss you  
  

"
293,Gary Numan,Love Like A Ghost,"I've seen enough of life,  
Enough to last a lifetime.  
I've seen too many tears,  
Far too many tears.  
I don't know the answer,  
I don't know the question.  
So show me something good,  
Something to believe in.  
CHORUS:  
Love like a ghost, in the dark.  
Love like a ghost, in my heart.  
So let's talk of love,  
Maybe for the last time.  
You will remember me,  
I'm the one who died for you.  
So she'll take everything,  
Everything and nothing.  
I can't do anything,  
Anything at all.  
(repeat chorus to fade)  

"
294,Gary Numan,Love Needs No Disguise,"She dances  
He watches  
She sighs  
Remember  
Love needs no disguise  
In motion  
That cannot deny  
She's saying  
Love needs no disguise  
And if the park gates are closed  
Remember we toured the skys  
And if the 'friends' all go home  
You know love needs no disguise  
He dances  
And we realised  
Remember  
Love needs no disguise  
In simple embraces  
They lie  
In darkness  
Love needs no disguise  
And we can lock all the doors  
Forget the reasons and fame  
There's no deceiving inside  
You know we'll all be the same  

"
295,Gary Numan,M. E.,"And m.e. I eat dust  
We're all so run down  
I'd call it my death  
But I'll only fade away  
And I hate to fade alone  
Now there's only m.e.  
  
We were so sure  
We were so wrong  
But there's no one left to see  
And there's no one left to die  
There's only m.e.  
  
Why shoud I care  
Why should I try  
Oh no, oh no  
I turned off the pain  
Like I turned off you all  
Now there's only m.e.

"
296,Gary Numan,Machine And Soul,"She likes film  
Pictures too  
A friend of mine  
Something new  
  
She likes girls  
Lives my dreams  
Eats my face  
She says 'Time to make me scream'  
  
No crying  
She don't like tears  
My one chance  
Is corruption  
  
(So get up  
So get up and dance)  
  
She likes pain  
'E please Bob'  
Some heroes  
But she don't like God  
  
She likes rock  
MTV  
Sex machines  
She says 'Time to make me bleed'  
  
No romance  
No surprise  
My one chance  
Is perversion  
  
So this is  
My secret  
So this is  
A new way to hide  
  
So this is  
My nightmare  
And you're my  
Solution  
  
No memories  
Nostalgia  
My one chance  
Is slow motion  
  
So this is  
The big lie  
So this is  
My reason to leave  
  
So this is  
My future  
And you're my  
Corruption  
  
She likes speed  
Low fast cars  
Love and hate  
Rock and roll stars  
  
She likes cream  
Long goodbyes  
Someone to watch  
And she says 'Time to make me cry'  
  
I'm nervous  
She scares me  
My one chance  
Is emotion  
  
So this is  
Religion  
So this is  
Something to believe  
  
So this is  
God's disease  
So this is  
A new kind of cure  
  
So this is  
A new world  
And you're my  
Machine and soul  

"
297,Gary Numan,Magic,"When I sleep  
I slide into  
Some heaven  
But no one is there.  
  
If I believed,  
If I should wonder,  
If I forgive  
Then would you come for me?  
  
When I sleep  
I hear sad words  
Songs of god  
That show me the lie.  
  
'I'll keep you safe,  
I'll keep you warm and  
I'll keep you here,  
Alone forever.'  
  
And I believe in faith and magic.  
And I believe in love and wonder.  
And I'll believe in you when you come for me.  
And I'll believe in you when the world comes apart

"
298,Gary Numan,Me! I Disconnect From You,"The alarm rang for days  
You could tell from conversations  
I was waiting by the screen  
I couldn't recognize my photograph  
Me, I disconnect from you  
  
I was walking up the stairs  
Something moved in silence  
I could feel his mind decaying  
Only inches away from me  
And I disconnect from you  
  
Please don't turn me off  
I don't know what I'm doing outside  
Me and the telephone that never rings  
If you were me what would you do?  
Me, I disconnect from you

"
299,Gary Numan,Mean Street,"My friends have  
Been demoted to  
Stay  
Second class  
  
Someone tells me  
Reliable  
Big brother will  
Never last  
  
Seems like I  
Outgrew my station  
Sweet young boys turning green  
This is for your information  
  
Mean Street I'd love to see you cry  
Mean Street I'd love to see you die  
Mean Street I really don't know why  
Mean Street you let me down  
  
Look at him  
Taking all our glory  
Let's kick him out  
  
'Who will say?'  
'Don't look at me'  
'He'll find out in a roundabout way'  
  
We don't owe him anything  
We don't need him anymore  
Drop him cold now spread the lies  
No-one even said goodbye  

"
300,Gary Numan,Miracles,"I don't believe in miracles  
I don't believe in forgiving  
I don't believe in I can go on  
I won't remember why  
I don't believe in long goodbyes  
Never look back for me  
  
It's over  
And everything has gone  
And everything has gone away  
  
I don't remember the faces  
I don't remember the feelings  
I don't remember your stories  
I won't remember you  
I don't remember our secrets  
My God just look at me  
  

"
301,Gary Numan,Moral,"These new romantics are oh so boring  
I could swear I've been there once or twice before  
I should grow wings and just forget the club  
You know the legends never wanted to be me  
For too erratic to be OK so?  
If you're concerned well I don't care  
You play games, you play safe  
Me I just sighed with relief  
  
Matthew's mother. The change disturbs me  
You've everybody's friend. Age, I suppose  
Just like religion you're going nowhere  
Like your so explicit clothes onto the floor  
On those occasions when everything broke down  
Including you and me  
  
See the boy, see the girl  
The exhibition is now over

"
302,Gary Numan,My Brother's Time,"Sometimes they try to forget and sometimes they do  
Giving love for the financial gain  
She's so good with excuses and incorrect reasons  
I'm tired of trying to win and you're tired of me  
  
She knows how to stand in the corner  
And whisper the words that you need  
She knows how to stand in the corner  
And whisper the words with that cynical charm  
We could dance  
Now it's my brother's time  
  
Here on the floor with these very loose young girls  
Like someone in Japan who just lied  
If the innocent are saved then what happens to her  
What's done is done and everything's different somehow  
  
I keep a book of reflections that sometimes appear in her eyes  
I keep a book of reflections  
And realise there's nothing much that I can do  
We could dance  
Now it's my brother's time  
  

"
303,Gary Numan,My Love Is A Liquid,"Can you see her little eyes?  
Can you see her little hands?  
Don't you think she looks just like me?  
Can you hear her little scream?  
Can you hear her little cry?  
Don't you think she sounds just like me?  
  
[Chorus]  
You have friends and we have reasons  
I can't meet you face-to-face  
There are no corners to hide in my room  
No doors, no windows, no fireplace  
  
My love is only for me  
My love needs nobody else  
Did you know that my love is a liquid?  
I could talk to me for years  
I can't speak to you at all  
Did you know that friends come in boxes?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Save your money buy a tube  
Let your body flow inside  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
  
[Chorus]

"
304,Gary Numan,O.d. Receiver,"Heartbeat  
I can't see you  
Heartbeat  
I can hear you  
I feel you pumping just beyond my door  
I know exactly  
What you've crawled here for  
Cringe down lower  
You're all dressed in grey  
Me, I'm still breathing  
It's just not your day  
  
I hear you whisper like an open grave  
O.D. Receiver, I am all you crave  
You're dying, crying, I can hear you fall  
Your bony fingers scratching on my wall  
  
O.D. Receiver  
  
I hear you screaming, well at least you try  
Me, I'm still smiling but I don't know why  
I'd call a doctor if I had the time  
But I'm so busy with this fix of mine  
  
O.D. Receiver...  

"
305,Gary Numan,Please Push No More,"Now I'm behind glass  
I'll talk to you  
The telephone lines blind  
You have defaced my face  
I bet you laughed at me  
You bright young things  
And now I need no-one  
I miss you, so  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more  
  
Now it's all over for sure  
I'll walk back home  
We must all come down  
We all grow old  
We are close, we are hurt  
So that was love  
And love she kills me  
It needs to, so  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more  
  
Please push no more  
Please push no more

"
306,Gary Numan,Prophecy,"We are deceived  
Valhalla is falling  
We are betrayed  
We are lost and forsaken.  
He's sold the world  
Sold us all to the hunger  
The body of Christ  
Is as black as his soul.  
  
The word of the Lord  
Is the lie of your father  
This mortal sin  
Is a voice of shame.  
Look at the storm  
Like a dying apostle  
Cruel and divine  
Like the ghost of man.  
  
And now you realise  
I am the truth.  
  
Worship the dead  
The damned and misled  
Tortured and bled  
Like the voices of reason.  
Sacred and pure  
Sanctified obsession  
Holy and cured  
Like a doorway to heaven.  
  
Sisterhood cried  
Innocence lied  
Purity died  
With the angels of passion.  
Blessed are they  
Who pay homage to rumour  
I've seen the light  
Shine on the grave of Man.  
  
And now you realise  
I am the truth.  
  
And I believed.  
Amen.

"
307,Gary Numan,Radio Heart,"I lose myself in the night  
Walking the streets in the rain.  
I turn away from the light  
To find the shadows again.  
I see her face in the window  
I feel the touch of her hand  
I hear her voice say ""I need you""  
I guess I can't understand  
Radio Heart  
Play a sad song for me  
One fom the heart  
So she'll come back for me  
Radio Heart  
Send her my love for me  
I hear a sound in the night  
Could be the turn of a key  
And when I switch on the light  
It's you I'm hoping to see  
Imagination  
You play a cruel cool game  
Imagination  
You leave me calling her name  
Radio Heart  
Play a sad song for me  
One from the heart  
So she'll come back for me  
The morning after  
I find no inspiration  
No love no laughter  
Just my imagination  

"
308,Gary Numan,Stormtrooper In Drag,"So here am I  
Quite by chance near the phone  
I could call and make you crawl into bed  
  
Questions always questions  
I'll just speak in slow motion  
About obsessions with boys on the floor  
  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Don't say sorry for me  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Don't say sorry for me  
  
Now look at me  
Like a stormtrooper in drag  
I'll bet you feel exactly like I do  
It's so disgusting  
I'm so tired of  
Rhythm and needles in arms  
I don't want your point of view  
  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And there's nothing to say  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And there's nothing to say  
  
Oh, don't cry  
Love it, love it  
I need to  
  
Stop it

309,Gary Numan,Strange Charm,"I don't know  
I don't know  
The dream was everything  
  
I don't know  
I don't know  
If it's all falling down.  
I lose connection as they let me down  
  
What you gonna think?  
What you gonna do?  
What you gonna say?  
Are you gonna scream 'Oh no'?  
What you gonna think?  
What you gonna do?  
What you gonna say?  
I just don't like this thing, at all.  
(Strange charm)  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the fun begin  
  
Let the boys out  
Let the boys out  
And let the night come in.  
  
We don't like it  
We don't like it  
We're from the factory and we've come to play.  
Let the boys out.  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
Come closer and talk to me  
  
You push too hard  
You push too hard  
D'you get the picture now?  
  
You won't like it  
You won't like it  
We get impatient as the time runs out.  
Let the boys out.  

"
310,Gary Numan,The Aircrash Bureau,"Hello, I'm the aircrash bureau  
I bet you're so surprised to see me  
I could specialize in rumours  
I'll send shivers up your spine  
  
Pilot, back, I need my squadron  
I was flying before d-day  
Now I'm warning you of falling  
I'll tell you when you're going down  
  
Sometimes I get these questions  
It reminds me of the skin game  
We used to stand around on corners  
Saying 'well here we are again'  
  
So now she motions closer  
Now that's what I call romance  
Someone's calling me but vaguely  
You need the feeling not the man

"
311,Gary Numan,The Fall,"Put your hate in a box  
See how it bleeds for you  
I've watched you  
Take your life and tear it apart  
  
Put your pain in a box  
I'll send it back to you  
What have you become?  
A shadow of a man  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing  
  
Put your lies in a box  
How have they worked for you?  
Did they win you back  
The things that you lost?  
  
Put your shame in a box  
How could you be so wrong?  
You sit there broken  
And the world moves on  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing  
  
How does it feel?  
I'll spare a little thought for ""The Crow""  
How does it feel?  
Living in the black of your soul  
How does it feel?  
Like a beggar out caught in the cold  
How does it feel?  
With nothing but the truth left untold  
  
Do you fall like tears on an ocean?  
Drowning in rage like a poisoned emotion  
Do you fall like a fading desire?  
Lost and unloved a forgotten ""messiah""  
  
Do you fall like rain on the crying?  
Cold and alone like the bitter and dying  
Do you fall like dust on a ruin?  
Empty and dead like the life you are losing

"
312,Gary Numan,The God Film,"She's like death on two legs  
She is raw pink shame  
Please stop the God film  
It's all wrong  
But I'm not to blame  
  
These boys of image  
Carry banners  
Believe in slogans  
Kill policeman  
  
Say it's 'freedom'  
Say it's 'goodness'  
Say it's 'peaceful'  
I'm lonely  
I'm feeling down (everyone I know has been and gone)  
  
It's such a sick picture  
She says 'i cure everyone'  
I'm alone in a corner  
I won't ever forgive  
I must be broken  
I don't know  
Who on earth can I blame?

"
313,Gary Numan,Torn,"Silently I wait alone for you  
I've got to put my fear back in its box  
Silently I feel you breathe on me  
And I hear mercy sigh and leave the room  
You could hurt me  
Take my breath away.  
Would you like that?  
You could rip me  
Leave me torn and cold.  
Would you like that?  
One More Sin. Make me unforgiven  
Silently, I turn and play begins  
I watch you smile  
Just like a dead things smiles  
Silently I lose and darkness comes  
I hear you laugh as God abandons me  
You could cut me  
Let me die for you.  
Would you like that?  
All I feel. Makes me unforgiven

"
314,Howard Jones,All I Want,"Ride the wild one cowboy in the rodeo  
Love like crazy juliet and romeo  
Living only to consume  
Bruising hearts collecting gloom  
Seems no place to hide away  
From the hammer and caress  
Dress with passion  
Fashion for the parking lot  
Make some action  
Pushing time out of the clock  
Take away identity  
Parcel up what's left of me  
Water down the youthful drop  
Call the sane insanity  
  
All I want is to live with you  
All I want is to cry with you  
  
Dance til sunrise  
Reggae til the cows come home  
Fight the bigot  
Champion you're not alone  
I can sort of work things out  
Juggling the fear and doubt  
Even when it's watertight  
In the end I have to say  
  
I can sort of work things out  
Juggling the fear and doubt

In the end I have to say I have to say  
  
Ride the wild one cowboy in the rodeo  
Love like crazy Juliet and Romeo

"
315,Howard Jones,Assault And Battery,"The lives were taken  
For feasts at the table  
A life of misery  
Ending with a shock  
  
Brutal murder (brutal murder)  
All hands to the slaughter  
Mass torture  
All hands to the knife  
  
And I can hear the screams  
With the knife, the jolt, the wring  
They must follow in our dreams  
Carrying a twisted sting  
  
Children's stories with their farmyard favourites  
At the table in a different disguise  
  
Don't talk to me of health  
Or something someone else will do  
We're talking about the act  
Of taking life for me and you  
And I hear their screams

"
316,Howard Jones,Automaton,"He arrived on the scene  
With no past and no future  
He seemed to know your dreams  
Replace tears with laughter  
  
Street corner whispers  
Would mention his name  
Selfish? Benevolent?  
What was his game  
  
Some say he's perfect  
Some say a spy  
A hidden power  
They all wonder why  
The rumors mounted  
But still no fact?  
I need to find out  
Some say perfect hidden power  
We all wonder why  
  
Questions unanswered  
Suspicion alerted  
I went round to his place  
If felt quite deserted  
I climbed the stairs to where  
His body lay without motion  
No spirit lives in there  
The cord had been broken  
  
His skin was reptile  
No life in there  
Not young not old  
A long hollow glare  
His breath had stopped  
No hearts beat there  
Is this a man  
Should I believe hidden power  
They all wondered why  
  
My attention was caught  
By a sound from the door  
Panic gripped the mind  
What lay in store  
A being stared at me  
Benevolent, not cold  
Automaton - he is controlled  
  
His skin was reptile.....  
  
Automaton - no life in there  
No past and no future  
Is this a man  
Automaton - no life in there  
No past and not future  
Is this a man

"
317,Howard Jones,Blue,"Lay at my side and shut out the world  
Warm this cold heart and wrap me in love  
Pour magic into a space made for you  
Lifetimes of longing are to live through  
Blue blue blue blue blue blue  
All of my life I've hungered for you  
All my lost days of dreaming are through  
Riding the clouds on a mission of schemes  
Now you are here oh how simple it seems  
Blue blue blue blue blue blue  
Blue is my world cold is my name  
Love was my problem with no one to blame and you  
Taught me how to see light shine in me  
Light is reflected so easily  
I said blue no more blue don't say good-bye  
You leave me breathless with nothing to say  
Turned me burned me and blew me away  
And if you leave like a ghost without trace  
This night of love means a world I can face  
Blue blue blue blue blue blue  
Holding you close timeless together  
Heaven just spoke freeze this moment forever and  
All other images fall from my eyes  
Love you have come to me straight from the skies  
I said blue no more blue  
I said blue no more blue don't say good-bye  
I will always know that love can live  

"
318,Howard Jones,Bounce Right Back,"I was walking down the street  
With my old friend luke  
And the strangest thing we saw  
There was a flash like dynamite  
And we fell down to the floor  
And as we looked up this weird dude stood  
I guess he was standing about four feet five  
With a nonchalance and a joie de vivre  
His face was grinning from side to side  
  
Chorus  
Well he said button up and tighten your lip  
Keep a check on what you say  
Those crazy words you fling from your mouth  
Are going to bounce back on you some day  
  
Now several years pass  
I thought nothing more  
It was down to a nine to five grind  
I was shuffling round to my old friend's house  
I had party on my mind  
While chatting this chick  
A guerilla muscled in  
A brace of henchmen right behind  
My blood boiled hard  
I'll give you a piece of my mind  
And this guy appeared by my side  
Don't you know what he said  
  
Chorus  
  
I was walking down the street with my old friend luke  
We were getting into a bit of a heavy scene  
He say yes and I say no  
He say what do you mean  
I pulled my piece and he pulled his  
We stared each other right in the eye  
There was a flash like dynamite  
And this guy appeared by our side  
  
Chorus

"
319,Howard Jones,Change The Man,"Don't talk to me about ban the bomb  
Don't talk to me about who's side I'm on  
Replace the system with one just the same  
Don't you know that we are all to blame  
It's so easy as an armchair blamer  
Get off your seat and make a personal change sir  
Can't change the system by smashing it down  
Inside route personal revolution  
Chorus  
Change the man  
Rip out the root  
Let's get rid of this insanity  
When the mothers had told the kids straight  
When the fathers felt no more hate  
When a man can walk down the street without fear  
Then thing must change and it's not too late  

"
320,Howard Jones,City Song,"It was that night at nowhere,  
I saw you standing there  
Darlin' you were hungry for life,  
an innocent in this land  
  
What is it about this city,  
that brings us all to life  
Ten millions souls vibrating,  
They're shimmering in the night  
  
You mustn't think of staying,  
The price is more than you'd think  
It's giving up the sweetest part of you,  
For this heartless prize  
  
When does a vision of heaven  
become a living hell  
Ten million souls vibrating,  
they're acting it out for real  
  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
When they want some lovin'  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
when they feel like cryin'  
  
It was that night at nowhere,  
a cold glass in your hand  
Darlin' you were angry with life,  
a prisoner in this land  
  
What is it about this city,  
that brings us all to life  
Ten millions souls vibrating,  
They're shimmering in the night  
  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
When they want some lovin'  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
when they feel like cryin'  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
in this crowded city  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
there's no sanctuary  
  
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to handshake, nowhere to smile  
Won't you talk with me  
Spend some time and give me life  
When does a vision of heaven  
become a living hell  
Ten million souls vibrating  
They're shimmering in the night  
  
Where do all the lonely people go,  
in this crowded city  
Where do all the lonely people hide,  
there's no sanctuary  
  
A vision of heaven  
A vision of heaven

"
321,Howard Jones,Dream Into Action,"Between every man there is a division  
Nobody ever seems to get it right  
Even between friends there is a long gap  
One of them makes a mistake, there is a fight  
Whatever you do you have the benefit of the doubt  
Whatever I do please understand  
Whatever we do let's make a pledge to put it right  
So we can end the rule of the division  
Putting the dream into action, into action  
Putting the dream into action, into action  
Whatever you like to do then let that be my pleasure  
Whatever you like to say I'll try to understand  
Whatever you do you have the benefit of the doubt  
Whatever I do please understand  
Whatever we do let's make a pledge to put it right  
So we can end the rule of the division  
Putting the dream into action into action  
You are strong  
We are strong  
You feel it  
We feel it  
You are strong  
We are strong  
You are action  
Putting the dream into action  

"
322,Howard Jones,Fallin' Away,"The manners of the heart  
We watched them grow  
Did we write everlasting love,  
In the Hollywood snow  
  
The ribbons and the bows  
Wrapped us with gold  
Such pressure heaven knows  
As the fairy tale folds  
  
Who heals the broken ones  
When love has gone  
You're not the only ones  
  
In an older time when the world was small  
When good men were standing  
Reaching out for mother love  
When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart  
Never thought I'd see  
You fallin' away from me  
  
Beneath the darker sky  
The stars are such a mess  
Can you forward my good-byes  
To some new address  
Who heals the broken ones  
When love has gone  
You're not the only ones  
  
In an older time when the world was small  
When good men were standing  
Reaching out for mother love  
When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart  
Never thought I'd see  
You fallin' away from me  
  
You can't turn back time  
We're stranded here  
Leave the future behind  
  
You're not the only ones  
In an older time when the world was small  
When good men were standing  
Reaching out for mother love  
When the ties of blood would cheer the faintest heart  
Never thought I'd see  
You fallin' away from me

"
323,Howard Jones,Fresh Air Waltz,"Looking at you now, you seem just a shadow  
You had the energy to recharge our batteries  
I suppose your success became your security  
Darkness is not what you need  
  
You were the one who refused to give up  
You were the one who lifted us, lifted us off our knees  
Now it's our turn to give you some help  
Fresh air that's just what you need  
  
Not the stale bread from the failing bitter table  
It's so hard  
Where's the justice we cry  
It's there and will follow us 'til the day we die, 'til  
The day that we die  
  
Looking at you know, you seem just a shadow  
You had the energy and you recharged our batteries  
Now it's our turn to give you some help  
Fresh air that's just what you need  
  
Now it's our turn to give you some help  
Fresh air that's just what you need  
That's just what you need

"
324,Howard Jones,Guardians Of The Breath,"They were guardians of the breath  
Trusted with those precious chances  
Keeping gaia from the fear of death  
Balances must be defended  
  
To take only what they must  
(borrowed from the future)  
Live in lovers of a global home  
(our children will remember)  
  
Guardians slept while comfort came  
The vapours poison, the acid rain fell  
The spirit cut from earthly bounds  
The creature stirred the pain  
  
How much abuse can she take  
(awake from your dreamtime)  
The lines are drawn our justice awaits  
(will the guardians surrender)  
  
The forest bare, a desert born  
The life pushed out  
They sold her cheaply  
All for a shilling for next weeks treat  
A marvel that had taken ten thousand years  
  
To take only what they must  
(borrowed from the future)  
Live in lovers of a global home  
(our children will remember)  
  
They are guardians of the breath  
Trusted with those precious chances  
They are guardians of the breath  
Balances must be defended

"
325,Howard Jones,Last Supper,"This is our last supper together  
The last time we share in this intimacy  
We have created a suffering circle that threatens to  
Tighten and destroy you and me  
  
Yesterday I flicked through the snapshots we  
Kept to remember the tender times  
Each little picture and each little memory should bring back a smile  
But now brings back a tear of regret  
  
Chorus  
Letting go is so hard  
Letting go is so hard  
So let us love tonight, thinking now of our greatest moments before we  
Release from this death in life drink the wine and take my hand  
Is it a crime to live this lie?  
I know that we will never share, share this love again  
  
But we both must be starting again, each one of  
Us too strong in these chains to remain  
This tug of war has weakened our purpose and  
Pulled us apart from beginning to end

"
326,Howard Jones,Law Of The Jungle,"Law of the jungle only the fit survive.  
Better make your life your own, do the survival jive.  
There are no answers, words are Cul-de-sac  
And the pity with actions... Difficult turning back  
  
Don't give a thought about those lucky dice  
Paranoid thoughts of worldly vice  
The big thumb it never rests on you  
Anything you want lies here for you...  
Takes a bit of time, means a bit of work  
Heart will give the sign it'll make me look.  
  
Ain't got a clue why I'm here at all  
So while I'm here I'm gonna have it all  
Science men won't explain a thing  
In this prison my soul must sing.  
  
Don't give a thought about those lucky dice  
Paranoid thoughts of worldly vice  
The big thumb it never rests on you  
Anything you want lies here for you...  
Takes a bit of time, means a bit of work  
Heart will give the sign it'll make me look

327,Howard Jones,Learning How To Love,"Creeping through your bedroom door  
Just after all the lights go out  
Feeling the warmth of your body  
And the sweetness of your mouth  
Set the alarm again for 5 am  
Uneasy sleep will soon be following  
Creeping back to my own bed again  
I will see you in our uneasy morning  
Chorus  
Learning how to love  
Learning how to love  
Learning how to love  
Learn how to love  
Sitting down at breakfast time  
A silence always fills the air  
Many things that should be said  
Are ending in a vacant stare  
And they know just what is going on  
But make us feel like we are criminals  
Our only wish is learning how to love  
Just a small word would make us feel it's natural  
Set the alarm again for 5 am  
Uneasy sleep will soon be following  
Creeping back to my own bed again  
I will see you in our uneasy morning  

"
328,Howard Jones,Left No Evidence,"Out of time and no one noticed  
Rubbing up a different way  
Out of step but still in focus things to say  
Kicking out the social pressure  
Holding on to what you feel  
Being you was never easy  
Sliding off the the ferris wheel  
Small was beautiful to you  
Things are on a micro scale  
Turned your back on power and glory  
Yours was such a personal tale  
Dancing to a different step now  
Choose you're beats along the way  
Nothing arrives at you're house packaged  
No glittery wrap to throw away  
Cutting different shapes and sizes  
Bringing tomorrow into today  
No one noticed you as you snuck in the sideline and talked in a quiet way  
No bullshit no theatrics no pretence and left no evidence  
You left no evidence  
You left no evidence  

"
329,Howard Jones,Let It Flow,"Where are the new rebels  
We didn't ask for this  
Trying to be something different  
We will fight the bigots  
Fight them with our reason  
Fight them with our constancy  
  
[Chorus]  
River, our river, let it flow  
This is our lamp light  
Let it glow  
River, river, let it flow  
This is our reason  
Let it grow  
Don't keep looking back  
Living in the past  
Never built a golden future. Have,  
Have faith in the species  
We've come to far to fail  
I don't believe in our extinction  
Everyone of us  
Has got to take it on  
Don't build a dam on evolution. There,  
There are those who'd like us  
To cling on to the past  
Wallowing in their past glories  
River, (don't)  
Our river, (don't look back)  
Let it flow (we might fall)  
This is our lamp light  
Let it glow (have faith in the future)  
River, (don't)  
River, (don't look back)  
Let it flow (we might fall)  
This is our reason  
Let it grow

330,Howard Jones,Let Me Be The First To Know,"If you find a time when things just seem to fall apart  
And there's no way to keep a cheery face  
When the sight of your own reflection only breaks your heart  
And all your dreams have given up the chase  
Pick up the telephone  
You know I'm always home  
Any old time of night or day  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
If you find a time when you just have to walk away  
Because of a call to pastures new  
You're in need of some fresh words to wish you on your way  
You need to fly on up and touch the moon  
Sharing this temporary weight  
No time to hesitate  
I will be everything you need  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first ...  
We're water breaking on an endless wave  
Potential bursting from the sea  
Compassion is what sets our minds apart  
Be cheerful when you break  
The chains of morality  
Oo, sharing this welcome weight  
Don't even hesitate  
I will be everything you need  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first one to know

C'mon c'mon c'mon lets do it right  
When the darkness takes control and we lose the reason  
C'mon c'mon c'mon lets see the light  
Well let the faith shine down on me and let the spirit carry me  
To a place where the stars don't know your name  
To a town where the children fly  
To a city where love comes naturally  
In a country where devils die  
I want to be there one more time  
When my brain is on the floor I need you to help me  
C'mon c'mon c'mon don't watch me die  
And a friend is someone that you allow to help you  
Carry me back carry me back hear me cry  
Well let the faith shine down on me and let the spirit carry me  
And I dreamt of a love that knows no gain  
And our guilt didn't paralyse  
Men and women and children can walk free  
In the world where our devils die  
I want to be there one more time  
I want to be there one more time, I want to be there one more time  
To a place where the stars don't know you're name  
To a town where the children fly  
To a city where love comes naturally  
In a country where devils die  
I want to be there one more time  
Well let the faith shine down on me and let the spirit carry me

333,Howard Jones,Life In One Day,"The old man said to me  
Said don't always take life so seriously  
Play the flute  
And dance and sing your song

The future will take care of itself somehow  
The grass is never greener over there

Don't go speed your time away  
Don't try to live your life in one day

And when I think of those who love you now  
If I had my chances again somehow  
Stop me from fallin' you know I need you  
To lift me up  
Won't you lift me up yeah  
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew  
And when you can see  
Another side of me  
I'm waiting for you  
  
I'm not eating I'm not sleeping this tension this worry  
You don't call you don't write me  
I need your love in a hurry  
Teach me, reach me, meet me, beat me,  
Tease me, please me,  
Come and seize me  
  
This is a man who has lost control  
Lost the road to a higher soul  
Catch me from fallin' you know I need you  
  
To lift me up  
Won't you lift me up yeah  
Won't you take me to a place that I once knew  
And when you can see  
You've always been there for me  
I'm waiting for your love  
And when you can see  
The changes I've made in me  
Well I'm waitin' for, you know I'm waitin' for your love

335,Howard Jones,Little Bit Of Snow,"Please don't throw you away we need you to stay  
When you die a part of us dies  
Not the body but part of the soul  
You have a light for us we need every glimmer  
Don't destroy yourself in a little bit of snow  
When there is no feeling and no pain  
It only lasts a little while  
When one light goes out a part of all of us cries  
  
Please hang on for us  
Please give you to us  
Don't destroy yourself in a little bit of snow  
  
Please don't throw you away we need you to stay  
When you die a part of us dies  
Not the body but part of the soul  
Drink the sunshine warm to the rain  
Keep the glimmer alive for all of us  
And a million matches in the night  
Will help to light the way  
When one light goes out  
A part of all of us cries  
  
Please hang on for us  
Please give you to us  
Don't destroy yourself in a little bit of snow  
  
Drink the sunshine, warm to the rain  
Keep the glimmer alive for all of us  
And a million matches in the night  
Will help to light the way  
When one light goes out  
A part of all of us cries

336,Howard Jones,Love's Never Wasted,"I remember the day we met  
Like a thunderbolt out of the blue  
You kinda liked the way I came across  
But it always meant more to me than it meant to you  
  
Recalling a daydream I had as a child  
A half hidden memory from a more innocent time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If your heart is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
On your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So no need to be worrying  
No need to count the cost  
No separating the inside from the outside world  
No finding No loss  
  
I'm remembering something, so distant so fine  
Ancient, eternal and still ahead of it's time  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the strangest of ways  
In your darkest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
  
So love with abandon  
Without judgement. Without fear  
With a confidence in tomorrow  
Love with a grin and a tear  
  
Not always reflected, not always fulfilled  
Love's not out to get you but wants you to build  
  
Your love is never wasted  
If that love is true  
All that you're giving  
Will always come back to you  
In the sweetest of ways  
On your brightest of days  
All that you're giving out  
Will surely be coming back to you  
Surely be coming back to you

337,Howard Jones,No One Is To Blame,"You can look at the menu, but you just can't eat  
You can feel the cushion, but you can't have a seat  
You can dip your foot in the pool, but you can't have a swim  
You can feel the punishment, but you can't commit the sin  
  
And you want her, and she wants you  
We want everyone  
And you want her and she wants you  
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame  
You can build a mansion, but you just can't live in it  
You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win  
Some break the rules, and let you cut the cost  
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost  
  
You can see the summit but you can't reach it  
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit  
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain  
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain  
  
No one ever is to blame, No one ever is to blame

338,Howard Jones,Pearl In The Shell,"And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing.  
Under his nose was a dream come true  
Been there all the time and he almost knew.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .  
Under his nose was a dream come true. ..  
Thoughts of people in misfortune stopped him doing things well  
  
His duty was to use it - left his pearl in the shell.  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing. .. .

339,Howard Jones,Respected,"Here in the dark, the shadows, they haunt me  
Here in the shade, oh, the bright lights, they blind me  
Yesterday is gone, time for moving on  
Here's a brand new start, gonna base it on my heart  
It's another day, I've got to find a better way  
Won't you help me?  
Failing that  
If you have to go  
It's all up to me, I know  
I just wanna change my world but from the inside  
I just wanna live my life  
And make this place, make this time  
For all our lives to be respected  
Here in the cold light of day, this vision  
Paints a different world, a world of the heart  
And I want to live there  
I've been on the run from all the people I've become  
I want to shed this skin and start it all again  
I want to draw a line in the sand for one last time  
Will you help me?  
Failing that  
If you have to go  
It's all up to me, I know  
I just wanna change my world but from the inside  
I just wanna live my life  
With some hope and to do what's right  
I just wanna change this world  
And make this place, make this time  
For all our lives to be respected  
I just wanna change my world  
(Change my world, ooh)  
I just wanna live my life and to do what's right  
(I just wanna live my life and to do what's right)  
I just wanna change this world

I just wanna live my life

340,Howard Jones,Rubber Morals,"Quickly checking what company he's in  
Absorbing values like a chameleon  
His rhythm and his method have got out of line  
When you sit on a fence you get a sore behind  
  
Must not upset the apple cart  
He'll choose your views today  
Having some kinda conflict  
Seems to get right in his way  
  
Chorus  
Whoa...rubber morals  
Whoa...rubber morals  
Whoa...rubber morals, plasticine ideals  
See how this one feels  
  
The men in st. peters will not agree to a slipping  
On his conscience like he slips on a johnnie  
He's a part time socialist and a part time tycoon  
Flags of convenience fly in his cocoon  
  
Must not upset the apple cart  
Preserve the status quo  
His heart felt convictions  
Left a long time ago  
  
A sign over his bed will testify  
Is there nothing in his life from which he'd live or die  
A pale shade of grey lines a vacant head  
With our condom-nation you are blessed  
  
Must not upset the apple cart  
He'll choose your views today  
Having some kinda conflict  
Seems to get right in his way

And the pain you can't break through  
I can't give you the answers  
But I believe in you  
  
Don't tell me you given up  
No don't tell me your truth  
  
Every vision and dream  
All the lives you've seen  
It's all, it's all inside  
Like the light in the sky  
Shines through your eyes  
It's all, it's all inside  
  
You could wait for an angel  
You could wait for the stars to fall  
All you want is a miracle  
But you don't need it at all

To watch over you  
I'll protect you from the world  
And the voices in your head  
I'll be with you  
With my life I will defend  
I'll be with you  
I will be there in the end  
And I'll cry your tears  
As you feel every pain  
Coax out the sun  
From the endless rain  
Thought I'd never feel  
So much love for another  
I'll be with you  
I will be there in the end  
Love that is there  
Through the false and the real  
Love that desires  
No reward and no gain  
As I hold your tiny hand  
You'll never know how I feel  
There's a promise  
With my life I will defend  
I will be there with you 'til the end  
And I'll cry your tears  
As you feel every pain  
Coax out the sun  
From the endless rain  
Thought I'd never feel  
So much love for another  
I'll be with you  
I will be there 'til the end  
All that potential  
Bursting inside  
Let me help you on your journey  
Let me help you with life  
I will be there with you 'til the end

343,Howard Jones,Someone You Need,"The streets here are empty, all the people went home  
Well, I was just wondering if you're alone  
So how you've been lately? I hear you're a little down  
And do you think maybe I could come around?  
  
[Chorus]  
I could be someone you need  
Wrap you in blankets on dark winter nights  
Be your best confidante, pay the right compliment  
I could be someone you need  
  
We had coffee on 3rd Street and talked for a time  
I still have your letter, I know every line  
I hope this ain't coming from way out of the blue  
'Cause I got to thinking and I thought of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You need someone there when the world isn't fair  
Or it's all just too good to be true  
Someone to care for you, issue a dare to you  
When the moment comes you need to fly, fly

344,Howard Jones,Specialty,"Don't chop off his head  
To make yourself look tall  
Don't tear a strip off  
To make yourself feel wonderful  
Who wants to compare  
As if this was a competition  
Leave that to teachers at school  
Must preserve their tradition  
'bout time you realized  
You are a specialty  
There is no one like you  
Spend your life worrying  
'bout what you could have been  
Can't you like being you  
Don't need a scalp  
Don't need to be a juror  
Take care of yourself  
No need to feel so insecure  
Waste of energy  
To prove a holier than him  
Waste of energy  
To find out who commits what sin  
'bout time you realized  
You are a specialty  
There is no one like you  
Spend your life worrying  
'bout what could have been  
Can't you like being you  
Don't chop off his head ...  
'bout time you realized ...  

"
345,Howard Jones,Spectrum,"Momentum seems to carry them  
But only for a moment  
A face that hides a thousand secrets  
Never seems to smile  
A feeling of uncertainty  
No hand to rock the cradle  
But we can hear a whispering inside  
  
Spectrum shifting  
Colours form  
The picture is changing  
Crystal calling  
Diamonds fall  
A time for creating  
Spectrum shifting  
Colours form  
The future is waiting  
  
Illusion holds a mystery  
But nothing lasts forever  
A searching for a hidden magic  
Waiting to be found  
A haunting sense of emptiness  
They hear the sound of silence  
But we can hear a whispering inside  
  
Spectrum shifting...

346,Howard Jones,The Prisoner,"You have watched me, safe in your anonymity  
I have dreamed you, held in your security  
Some people believe a photograph traps your mortal soul  
Your eyes ARE the camera and you've TAKEN hold  
And you captured me  
I need you to take control  
I am a prisoner of no confidence  
You've entered me now make me whole  
  
Every place I go I feel your lenses trained on me  
This distant concentration takes away my energy  
Your image burns it's negative  
Behind my waking eyes  
Then the night comes and you stalk your prize  
And you captured me  
I need you to take control  
I am a prisoner of no confidence  
You've entered me now make me whole  
  
Some people believe a photograph traps your mortal soul  
Your eyes were the camera and you've taken hold

347,Howard Jones,The Voices Are Back,"He saw flames in the department store  
He tried to get the people to the safety of the door  
There was no fire the voices were telling him what to do  
You could see from his face he needs someone  
To help pull him through  
The voices are back they're telling him what to do  
The voices are back they're telling him what to do  
Ripping through the fabric between his world and the real  
He's trying to protect you but  
The knife will know that your flesh meets steel  
Took him to an institution  
And they helped the voices go away  
But he didn't have the right set of papers  
So they put this boy in jail  
The voices are back they're telling him what to do  
The voices are back they're telling him what to do  
Six weeks turned to twelve  
He was locked up for twenty-three hours a day  
The warden found him in his cell  
His only crime was that he was ill  
The voices are back they're telling him what to do  
The voices are back they're telling him what to do

348,Howard Jones,Things Can Only Get Better,"We're not scared to lose it all  
Security throw through the wall  
Future dreams we have to realize  
A thousand skeptic hands  
Won't keep us from the things we plan  
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize  
  
And do you feel scared, I do  
But I won't stop and falter  
And if we threw it all away  
Things can only get better  
Wow wow wow oh, wow wow wow oh oh oh oh  
  
Treating today as though it was  
The last, the final show  
Get to sixty and feel no regret  
It may take a little time  
A lonely path, an uphill climb  
Success or failure will not alter it  
  
And do you feel  
Wow wow wow oh...  
And do you feel...

349,Howard Jones,Those Who Move Clouds,"The throwing of your mental clothes wasn't ever your intention  
The malady within your heart has no cure and prevention  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
I wish that I could offer you a chance to change direction  
But you know that pathways must be followed to near destruction  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
There are those who will patronise and compromise your position  
They can't feel the forceful hand of  
Predetermined destination  
There are those who move clouds  
Those who move clouds  
Heard it murmured in a far off crowd  
Those who move clouds  
  
I can feel the forceful hand  
And it won't let me change direction no  
And there's this hunger inside of me  
And it won't and it won't no it won't stop it's aching  
And I can feel it inside of my head the forceful hand  
And it won't let me change direction  
And there's this hunger and it won't let me  
And it won't let me stop and it won't let me stop this aching no

It looks to me like you're draggin' it around  
Like a heavy pack

We're to busy hangin' on  
To what's been and gone so it comes again  
Singin' the same old song

Forget about fate  
  
And I don't need to remind you  
Life is short and life is sweet  
And before you even know it  
Past and future gonna meet  
  
Oh, every day and every way  
Good to go oh oh

It's not too late to turn around  
What are the things important to you?  
Can't be the money  
Well I got news for you  
  
Two souls (should be two souls together)  
Two souls (in the life that we planned)  
But you're working obsession is squeezing me  
Out of your world  
  
I'd rather live in a doll's house in a small street  
Where it always rains  
You kid yourself you're working all for me  
But older kids play with bigger trains  
  
It's not too late to start over  
It's not too late to turn 'round  
It's like we live in separate worlds  
Can't buy the lost time  
I want my share of you  
I want my share of you

Hold the sky, feet on the floor  
Hold the sky, feet on the floor  
We make our sun to shine  
We make our space and time  
We make the weather  
We make it change  
Hell is not somewhere but a state of mind I choose to be  
When my faith in life has gone  
Cruelty rebounds to hurt itself puts shackles on the free  
Vicious circle carries on  
Hold the sky, feet on the floor  
We make our sun to shine  
We make our space and time  
We make the weather  
We make it change  
We make the weather  
We make it change  
Time to judge the act don't judge the actor of the circumstance  
Time to free compassion's world  
Life is not the end we're passing through like bubbles on the sea  
Time to learn and time to mend  
Hold the sky, feet on the floor  
We make our sun to shine  
We make our space and time  
We make the weather  
We made a change  
We make the weather  
We make a change

Faced at every turn  
And there's children

Reveal a thousand more  
Treasure each moment

The glory's over and the chill comes  
When the night comes, will you still be there  
Will you still be there when the night comes  
Will you still be there?  
When the world seems to fall apart for us  
When all the hope has turned to desperation  
How can we torture, torture the ones that we Love  
Can't let the feelings be left unsaid

How many have been broken in two

Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak  
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne  
Got to get up for the coming attack.  
  
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines  
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste  
Gathering speed as we head down the runway  
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Rolling, turning, diving, going in again.  
Running, scrambling, flying  
Rolling, turning, diving.  
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die  
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces high.  
  
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers  
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away  
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them  
Move to their blindsides and firing again.  
  
Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us  
Ten ME-109's out of the sun  
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them  
Heading straight for them I press down my guns  
  
Rolling, turning, diving

Run, live to fly, fly to live,  
Aces high.

356,Iron Maiden,Age Of Innocence,"I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more  
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart  
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause  
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all  
  
And all the politicians and their hollow promises  
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it  
The working man pays everything for their mistakes  
And with his life too if there was to be a war  
  
[Chorus]  
So we can only get one chance, can we take it?  
And we only got one life, can't exchange it  
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it  
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream  
  
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday  
The victims' mind are scarred for life most everyday  
Assailants know just how much further they can go  
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't protect yourselves even in your own home  
For fear of vigilante cries, the victims wipe their eyes  
So now the criminal they launch right in our face  
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace  
  
Despondent public worries, where it will all end?  
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend  
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst  
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

Driving a big bus with band on the front of it'

'Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave

Black Bart's seen it  
Black Bart knows  
Black Bart's done it  
The Black Bart blues  
Suspended in suspension  
Medieval nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems  
Black Bart's lookin'  
Don't know where she's been  
Maybe she's an acrobat  
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
Black Bart tried most anything  
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing  
So he asked me to tell ya  
Try it for yourself and you will see  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
  
'What did you do that for?'  
'I'm sorry, I just, I guess I'm not used to...  
'Shut up and get on with it will you'  
  
Black Bart's livin' across the ocean now  
Black Bart's lookin' to come back somehow  
So if you are a dancer,  
You could dance his pole in May  
That's a maypole  
  
Black Bart's coming  
Now Black Bart's gone  
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song  
Whatever and however,  
In and out or several at a time mmm yes!  
We all got to do the Black Bart blues  
Here comes the guitar solo  
  
We all got to try the Black Bart blues  
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!

358,Iron Maiden,Blood Brothers,"And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life  
What do you think you'd expect you would see?  
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life  
And in the river reflections of me  
  
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see  
And in a movement he beckons to me  
And in a moment the memories are all that remain  
And all the wounds are reopening again  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
And as you look all around at the world in dismay  
What do you see, do you think we have learned  
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray  
Out in the streets where the babies are burned  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
There are time when I feel I'm afraid for the world  
There are times I'm ashamed of us all  
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel  
And reflecting the good and the bad  
  
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?  
Can you really tell me what life is?  
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you  
Could be swept away by fate's own hand  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
When you think that we've used all our chances  
And the chance to make everything right  
Keep on making the same old mistakes  
Makes untipping the balance so easy  
When we're living our lives on the edge  
Say a prayer on the book of the dead  
  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers  
  
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life

359,Iron Maiden,Brave New World,"Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here  
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear  
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone  
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home  
  
Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all  
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall  
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell  
All is lost sold your souls to this brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
  
Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now  
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh  
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth  
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
A brave new world, in a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
In a brave new world, a brave new world  
  
Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

360,Iron Maiden,Brighter Than A Thousand Suns,"We are not the sons of God  
We are not his chosen people now  
We have crossed the path he trod  
We will feel the pain of his beginning  
  
Shadow fingers rise above  
Iron fingers stab the desert sky  
Oh behold the power of the Earth.  
Are your children ready for the fall?  
  
Locking hands together well  
Raze a city, build a living hell  
Join the race to suicide  
Listen for the tolling of the bell  
  
Out of the the universe, a strange light is born  
Unholy union, trinity reformed  
  
Yellow sun it's evil twin  
in the black the winds deliver him  
We will sleep to souls within  
At a siege a nuclear gust is riven  
  
Out of the the universe, a strange light is born  
Unholy union, trinity reformed  
  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns  
  
Burying our morals and burying our dead  
Burying our head in the sand  
E equals MC squared, you can't relate  
How we made God with our hands  
  
Whatever would Robert have said to his God  
About he made war with the Sun  
E equals MC squared, you can't relate  
How we made God with our hands  
  
All nations are rising  
Through acid bells of love and hate  
Chain medals of Satan  
Uncertainty led us all to this  
  
All nations are raising  
Through acid bells of love and hate  
Confusion and Fury  
  
This body carried em' down in vain  
I was preaching of a small pray  
In the bunker where we'll die  
We're the executioners that lie  
  
Bombers launched with no recall  
Minute warning of the missile fall  
Take a look at your last day  
Guessing you won't have the time to cry  
  
Out of the the universe, a strange light was born  
Unholy union, trinity reformed  
  
Out of the darkness  
Out of the darkness  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousands suns

361,Iron Maiden,Coming Home,"When I stand before you shining  
In the early morning sun  
When I feel the engines roar  
And I thing of what we've done  
  
Oh, the bittersweet reflection as  
We kiss the earth goodbye  
As the waves and echos of the  
Towns became the ghost of time  
  
Over borders that divide the  
Earthbound tribes  
No greed and no religion  
Just a hungred winged souls  
  
We will ride this thunderbird  
Silver shadows on the earth  
A thousand leagues away  
Our land of birth  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
Carving on the edge of daylight  
Till it slips into the void  
Waited in the long night dreaming  
Till the sun is born again  
  
Stretch the fingers of my hand  
Cover countries with my span  
Just a lonely satellite  
Speck of dust and cosmic sand  
  
Over borders that divide the  
Earthbound tribes  
Through the dark atlantic  
Over mariners stormy waves  
  
We will ride this thunderbird  
Silver shadows on the earth  
A thousand leagues away  
Our land of birth  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
Coming home, far away  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay

362,Iron Maiden,Cross-Eyed Mary,"Who would be a poor man, a beggar man, a thief  
If he had a rich man in his hand  
And who would steal the candy from a laughing baby's mouth  
If he could take it from the money man  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contract but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary finds it hard to get along  
A poor man's rich girl and she'll do it for a song  
A rich man's stealer but her favour's good and strong  
She's the Robin Hood of Highgate, let the poor man get along  
Laughing in the playground gets no kicks from little boys  
Would rather make it with a letching gray  
Or maybe her attention is drawn by Aqualung  
Who watches through the railings as they play  
Cross-eyed Mary goes jumping in again  
She signs no contracts but she always plays it clean  
She dines in Hampstead village, an expense accounted gruel  
And the jack knife barber drops her off at school  
Cross-eyed Mary, oh Mary, oh cross-eyed mary  

"
363,Iron Maiden,Dream Of Mirrors,"Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how?  
A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really
happening?  
  
Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place?  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation  
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more  
  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
  
Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before  
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind  
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality  
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation  
Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself  
  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
  
I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night  
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again  
Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare  
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head  
  
Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring  
Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox  
Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace  
Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place  
Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive  
I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself  
  
The dream is true, the dream is true  
The dream is true, the dream is true

364,Iron Maiden,Face In The Sand,"Everybody's waiting for something to happen  
Everybody's waiting for something to see  
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters  
Everyone's waiting for news on TV  
  
Winding lives at the end of the spiral  
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill  
Everyone's looking, but no one is listening  
Everybody wants to be in at the kill  
  
I wait for the signs, they tell me true  
I see the signs of the end of time  
  
Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing  
Everyone's looking for the reason why  
Everyone's hoping for life everafter  
Everyone's looking at death from the sky  
  
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen  
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes  
Everyone's praying but no one's believing  
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies  
  
I wait for the signs, they tell me true  
I see the signs of the end  
  
[Chorus]  
So I watch and I wait  
And I pray for an awnser  
An end to the strife and the world's misery  
But the end never came  
And we're digging the graves  
And we're loading the guns for the kill  
  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?  
Can the end be at hand?  
Is the face in the sand  
Future memory of our tragedy?

365,Iron Maiden,Fear Of The Dark,"I am a man who walks alone  
And when I'm walking a dark road  
At night or strolling through the park  
  
When the light begins to fade  
I sometimes feel a little strange  
A little anxious when it's dark  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
Have you run your fingers down  
The wall  
And have you felt your neck skin crawl  
When you're searching for the light?  
Sometimes when you're scared  
To take a look  
At the corner of the room  
You've sensed that something's  
Watching you  
  
Have you ever been alone at night  
Thought you heard footsteps behind  
And turned around and no one's there?  
And as you quicken up your pace  
You find it hard to look again  
Because you're sure there's  
Someone there  
  
Watching horror films the night before  
Debating witches and folklore's  
The unknown troubles on your mind  
Maybe your mind is playing tricks  
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix  
On dancing shadows from behind  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
When I'm walking a dark road  
I am a man who walks alone

366,Iron Maiden,Flash Of The Blade,"As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty,  
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.  
Times change very quickly,  
and you had to grow up early,  
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll die as you lived  
In a flash of the blade,  
In a corner forgotten by no one.  
You lived for the touch  
For the feel of the steel  
One man, and his honor.  
  
The smell of resigned leather  
The steely iron mask  
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.  
He taught you all he knew  
To fear no mortal man  
and now you'll wreak your vengeance in the  
Screams of evil men.

367,Iron Maiden,Flight Of Icarus,"As the sun breaks, above the ground,  
An old man stands on the hill,  
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light  
A birdsong shatters the still.  
  
His eyes are ablaze,  
See the madman in his gaze.  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly and touch the sun.  
  
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears  
Looks the old man in the eye  
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd  
In the name of God my father I fly.  
  
His eyes seem so glazed  
As he flies on the wings of a dream,  
Now he knows his father betrayed  
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave.  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,  
  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly and touch the sun.  
  
YEAH!  
  
Fly, on your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun,  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly as high as the sun.  
  
On your way, like an eagle,  
Fly, touch the sun.  
  
On your way, like a... eagle,  
Fly.  
  
Fly as high as the sun.

368,Iron Maiden,For The Greater Good Of God,"Are you a man of peace  
Or a man of holy war  
Too many sides to you  
Don't know which anymore  
So many full of life  
But also filled with pain  
Don't know just how many  
Will live to breathe again  
  
A life that's made to breathe  
Destruction or defense  
A mind that's vain corruption  
Bad or good intent  
A wolf in sheep's clothing  
Or saintly or sinner  
Or some that would believe  
A holy war winner  
  
They fire off many shots  
And many parting blows  
Their actions beyond a reasoning  
Only God would know  
And as he lies in heaven  
Or it could be in hell  
I feel he's somewhere here  
Or looking from below  
But I don't know, I don't know  
  
[Chorus:]  
Please tell me now what life is  
Please tell me now what love is  
Well tell me now what war is  
Again tell me what life is  
  
More pain and misery in the history of mankind  
Sometimes it seems more like  
The blind leading the blind  
It brings upon us more famine, death and war  
You know religion has a lot to answer for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And as they search to find the bodies in the sand  
They find its ashes that are  
Scattered across the land  
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind  
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins  
  
And all because of it you'd think  
That we would learn  
But still the body count the city fires burn  
Somewhere there's someone dying  
In a foreign land  
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man  
Tell me why, tell me why  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
For the greater good of God (x8)  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
For the greater good of God (x8)  
  
He gave his life for us  
He fell upon the cross  
To die for all of those  
Who never mourn his loss  
It wasn't meant for us  
To feel the pain again  
Tell me why, tell me why

369,Iron Maiden,Fortunes Of War,"After the war  
And now that they've sent us homeward  
I can't help but feel that I'm on my own  
No one can see just what this conflict has done to  
The minds of the men who are on their way home  
  
I'm scarred for life  
But it's not my flesh that's wounded  
So how can I face the torment alone  
The vivid scenes and all the recurring nightmares  
I lay there and sweat until it gets light  
  
People say 'don't worry'  
Say that time's a perfect healer  
That the nightmares they will come to pass  
Can't hear what they're saying  
I am living in my own world  
And I'm feeling trance-like all the time  
  
I hear voices in my head  
Could I really be going crazy  
In the night the visions seem so real  
Do you care if you live or die  
When you laugh are you really crying  
You're not sure what's real anymore  
  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
Fortunes of war  
No pain anymore  
  
Sometimes I wake  
I feel that my spirit's broken  
I wonder if I've the strength  
Carry on carry on

370,Iron Maiden,From Here To Eternity,"She fell in love with his greasy machine  
She leaned over wiped his head  
Kick start clean  
She'd never seen the beast before  
But she left there wanting  
More more more  
But when she was walking on  
Down the road  
She heard a sound that made  
Her heart explode  
He whispered to her to get on the back  
""I'll take you on a ride  
From here to eternity""  
  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity  
  
She must be having one of her  
Crazy dreams  
She'd never sat on a piece so mean  
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine  
She even thought she heard the  
Engine sigh  
  
But like all dreams that come to an end  
They took a tumble at the devil's bend  
The beast and Charlotte they were  
Two of a kind  
They'd always take the line  
From here to eternity  
  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity

I'm running out of breath  
And now it's getting so  
I can't sleep at night  
In the day, feel like death  
  
I'm getting in far too deep  
I feel them closing in  
I've got to say that I'm scared  
I know they'll win  
Even so, I'm prepared  
  
Do you believe, what you hear  
Can you believe, what you see  
Do you believe, what you feel  
Can you believe  
  
What is real?  
Futureal  
What is real?  
Futureal  
  
Whenever anyone seems  
To treat me like a freak  
It makes me see I'm the  
Only one who feels  
That I know what is real

Of deadly hide and seek  
And when you're reading this  
Then I'll be gone  
Maybe then, you will see

372,Iron Maiden,Gangland,"Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave  
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved

You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile  
  
Dead men, tell no tales  
Gangland, murder's up for sale  
Dead men, tell no tales  
Gangland, where jail birds die  
  
Face at the window leers into your own  
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones  
How long can you hide? How long till they come?  
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive  
  
Once you were glad to be free for a while  
The air tasted good and the world was your friend  
Then came the day when the hard times began  
Now you're alone, but alive for how long?  
  
A knife at your throat another body on the pile  
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile  
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain  
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail  
  
Dead men, tell no tales  
In Gangland, murder's up for sale  
Dead men, tell no tales  
In Gangland, where jail birds die  
  
In Gangland you tell no tales

373,Iron Maiden,Gates Of Tomorrow,"Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul  
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal  
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight  
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights  
  
To the women and children, the souls of the dead  
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed  
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap  
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself  
You can't blame a madman if you go insane  
Give me the strength so I carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isn't a god to save you if you don't save yourself  
You can't blame a madman if you go insane  
Give me the strength so I carry on

374,Iron Maiden,Ghost Of The Navigator,"I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey  
On the bow I stand, west is where I go  
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray  
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know, but I know, but I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son,  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been  
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so,  
Nothing's real until you feel  
  
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name  
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain  
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind  
For eternity I follow on there is no other way  
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun  
But I know, I know  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been  
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so  
Nothing's real until you feel  
  
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost  
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost  
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea  
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me  
  
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves  
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son  
Chasing rainbows all my days  
  
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been  
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so  
Nothing's real until you feel

"
375,Iron Maiden,Hallowed Be Thy Name,"I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime  
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time  
Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the Gallows Pole  
The sands of time for me are running low, yeah!  
  
When the priest comes to read me the last rites  
I take a look through the bars at the last sights  
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me  
  
Can it be that there's some sort of error  
Hard to stop the surmounting terror  
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?  
  
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming  
It's not easy to stop from screaming  
The words escape me when I try to speak  
Tears flow, but why am I crying  
After all I'm not afraid of dying  
Don't I believe that there never is an end  
  
As the guards march me out to the courtyard  
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""  
If there's a God then why has he let me go?  
  
As I walk my life drifts before me  
Though the end is near I'm not sorry  
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away  
  
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on  
Don't worry now that I have gone  
I've gone beyond to seek the truth  
  
When you know that your time is close at hand  
Maybe then you'll begin to understand  
Life down here is just a strange illusion.  
Yeah hallowed be thy name  
Yeah hallowed by thy name  
Yeah

"
376,Iron Maiden,Heaven Can Wait,"Can't understand what is happening to me,  
This isn't real, this is only a dream,  
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before,  
I'm looking down on my body below,  
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,  
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?  
I can't believe that really my time has come,  
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,  
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Heaven can wait,  
Heaven can wait,  
Heaven can wait,  
Heaven can wait til another day.  
  
I have a lust for the Earth below  
And Hell itself is my only foe,  
'Cause I've no fear of dying,  
I'll go when I'm good and ready,  
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,  
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,  
At all of the people standing there in front of me,  
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,  
Is this the place where the living join the dead?  
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land,  
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality,  
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side,  
To see the truth, the path for you is decided.  
  
Oh oh lots.  
  
My body tingles, I feel so strange,  
I feel so tired, I feel so drained,  
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again,  
Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?  
Maybe I'm going down there as well,  
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.  
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,  
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?  
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?  
  
[Chorus]

"
377,Iron Maiden,Holy Smoke,"Believe in me, send us money  
Died on the cross and that ain't funny  
But my so called friends they're making me a joke  
They missed out what I said like I never spoke  
They choose what they want to hear, they don't tell a lie  
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die  
They're saving your souls by taking your money  
Flies around shit, bees around honey  
  
[Chorus]  
Holy Smoke Holy Smoke, plenty bad preachers for  
The Devil to stoke  
Feed'em in feet first this is no joke  
This is thirsty work making Holy Smoke yeah  
making Holy Smoke  
  
Jimmy Reptile and all his friends  
Say they gonna be with you at the end  
Burning records burning books  
Holy soldiers nazi looks  
Crocodile smiles just wait a while  
Till the TV queen gets her make-up clean  
I've lived in filth I've lived in sin  
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holy Smoke, smells good  
  
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools  
When Noah built his cadillac it was cool  
Two by two they're still going down  
And the satellite circus just left town  
I think they're strange and when they're dead  
They can have a Lincoln for their bed  
Friend of the president trick of the tail  
Now they ain't got a prayer 100 years in jail  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holy Smoke

"
378,Iron Maiden,Hooks In You,"I got the keys to view at number 22  
Behind my green door there's nothing to see  
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence, laid  
Back and looking for sympathy  
I like a girl who knows where she's bound  
I don't like girls who've been hanging around  
  
[Chorus]  
Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling  
For that well hung feeling  
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I  
Got the hooks screwed in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's tied up she can't come to the phone  
You must have got your wires crossed 'cause she ain't home  
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound  
She never could keep her feet on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Right on the money got it wrapped up tight  
New ideas for the decor tonight  
Gonna make this house a preservation zone  
Gonna set her in concrete set her up on her own

379,Iron Maiden,I Can't See My Feeling,"(Burke Shelley, Tony Bourge, Steve Williams)  
[Originally by Budgie]  
I can't see my feelings  
Open my eyes  
I can't see my feelings  
Open a pair of eyes  
I can't see my feelings  
Keep them behind  
I just keep on reeling  
Running back down the line  
Oh, I can't stand that screaming  
Don't even try  
Music fans some feelings  
It'll be tell me why  
I can't stop that feeling  
Showing me why  
Man I love that feeling  
Yeah, blowin' me right through the sky  
Oh hey hey hey hey hey hey  
Oh, listen to what she says  
If it's good, it's nice

"
380,Iron Maiden,Infinite Dreams,"Infinite dreams I can't deny them  
Infinity is hard to comprehend  
I couldn't hear those screams  
Even in my wildest dreams  
  
Suffocation waking in a sweat  
Scared to fall asleep again  
Incase the dream begins again  
Someone chasing I cannot move  
Standing rigid nightmare's statue  
What a dream when will it end  
And will I transcend?  
  
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil  
One nightmare ends another fertile  
Getting to me so scared to sleep  
But scared to wake now, in too deep  
  
Even though its reached new heights  
I rather like the restless nights  
It makes me wonder it makes me think  
There's more to this I'm on the brink  
It's not the fear of what's beyond  
It's just that I might not respond  
I have an interest almost craving  
But would I like to get too far in?  
  
It can't be all coincidence  
Too many things are evident  
You tell me you're an unbeliever  
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither  
But wouldn't you like to know the truth  
Of what's out there to have the proof  
And find out just which side you're on  
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?  
  
Help me, help me to find my true  
Self without seeing the future  
Save me, save me from torturing  
Myself even within my dreams  
  
There's got to be  
More to it than this  
Or tell me why do we exist  
I'd like to think that when I die  
I'd get a chance another time  
And to return and live again  
Reincarnate, play the game  
Again and again and again and again

"
381,Iron Maiden,Innocent Exile,"My life is so empty, nothing to live for.  
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law.  
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.  
I never had no trouble before this all began.  
  
My life is so empty, nothing to live for.  
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law.  
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.  
I never had no trouble before this all began.  
  
I'm running away, no where to go.  
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know, yeah,  
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true.  
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you, yeah

"
382,Iron Maiden,Invaders,"Longboats have been sighted the evidence of war has begun  
Many Nordic fighting men their swords and shields all gleam in the sun  
Call to arms defend yourselves get ready to stand and fight for your lives  
Judgment day has come around so be prepared don't run stand your ground  
  
They're coming in from the sea  
They've come the enemy  
Beneath the blazing sun  
The battle has to be won  
Invaders, pillaging  
Invaders, looting  
  
Set ablaze the campfires alert the other men from inland  
Warning must be given there's not enough men here for a stand  
The Vikings are too many much too powerful to take on our own  
We must have reinforcements we cannot fight this battle alone  
  
They're coming over the hill  
They've come to attack  
They're coming in for the kill  
There's no turning back  
Invaders  
Fighting  
Invaders  
Marauding  
  
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground  
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around  
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle weary fight to the end  
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen  
  
You'd better scatter and run  
The battle's lost and not won  
You'd better get away to fight another day  
Invaders  
Raping  
Invaders  
Plundering

"
383,Iron Maiden,Iron Maiden,"Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares.  
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.  
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.  
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh Well, wherever, wherever you are,  
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far.  
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head.  
Iron Maiden wants you for dead.  
  
Won't you come into my room, I want to show you all my wares.  
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.  
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.  
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

"
384,Iron Maiden,I've Got The Fire!,"If you're looking for someone that you can keep  
then, baby, pass me by  
And if you wanted something that's twenty years deep  
Baby, don't even try  
And if you wanted someone to take your soul  
I'll lift you up little bit higher  
  
I've got the fire  
I've got the fire  
  
So you think I'm skinny, don't you sell me cheap  
I'm as wide as a country-mile  
Some like it wide, I like it deep  
Guess which one is my style  
So you think you can beat me by my own game  
Maybe I call you a liar  
  
I've got the fire  
I've got the fire

"
385,Iron Maiden,Journeyman,"From the red sky of the east  
To the sunset in the west  
We have cheated death  
And he has cheated us  
  
But that was just a dream  
And this is what it means  
We are sleeping  
And we'll dream for evermore  
  
And the fragment remains of our memories  
And the shadows remain with our hands  
Deep gray, came to mourn  
All the colors of the dawn  
Will this journeyman's day be his last?  
  
[Chorus]  
I know what I want  
And I say what I want  
And no one can take it away  
I know what I want  
And I say what I want  
And no one can take it away  
  
But the memory still remains  
All the past years not so strange  
Our winter times are like a silent shroud  
And the heartbeat of the day  
Drives the mist away  
And winter's not the only dream around  
  
In your life you may choose desolation  
And the shadows you build with your hands  
If you turn to the light  
That is burning in the night  
Then the journeyman's day has begun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In your life you may choose desolation  
And the shadows you build with your hands  
If you turn to the light  
That is burning in the night  
Then the journeyman's day has begun

386,Iron Maiden,Judas Be My Guide,"Lights out  
We live in a world  
Of darkness  
No doubt  
Everything's up for sale  
We sleep  
All of the world is burning  
We pray  
To god for a better deal  
Nothing is sacred  
Back then or now  
Everything's wasted  
Is that all there is?  
Can I go now?  
  
Judas my guide  
Whispers in the night  
Judas my guide  
  
Fight wars  
Die in a blaze of glory  
Come home  
Meat in a plastic sack  
Fall down  
Better pray to your God  
For mercy  
So kneel  
And help the blade cut clean  
Nothing is sacred  
Back then or now  
Everyone's wasted  
Is that all there is?  
Is that it now?  
  
I live in the black  
I have no guiding light  
I'm whispering in your dreams  
  
Judas my guide  
Whispers in the night  
Judas my guide  
  
Judas my guide  
Whispers in the night  
Judas my guide

387,Iron Maiden,Judgement Day,"There are no marks upon a man  
That can say he's good or bad  
No label and no tell tale sign  
That can show he's full of lies  
  
By your deeds you will be known  
Time will tell truth will show  
As we exhale every breath  
We all get closer to our death  
What will you say  
What will you say  
On judgement day  
On judgement day  
  
When you look into their eyes  
You don't know what they hide  
No label and no tell tale sign  
That can show he's full of lies  
  
By your deeds you will be known  
Time will tell truth will show  
As we exhale every breath  
We all get closer to our death  
What will you say  
What will you say  
On judgement day  
On judgement day  
  
Ignorance is bliss is that the reason  
We can not read another's mind  
If we knew what thoughts were dancing  
Through each others heads  
Would we all be driven mad  
Would we all be dead  
  
By your deeds you will be known  
Time will tell truth will show  
As we exhale every breath  
We all step closer to our death  
What will you say  
What will you say  
On judgement day  
On judgement day

388,Iron Maiden,Judgement Of Heaven,"A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone  
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way  
I've been depressed so long  
It's hard to remember when I was happy  
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more  
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way  
the hardest part is to get on with your life  
  
You're searching in the dark  
clutching at straws to find a way  
You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind  
  
Your questions your beliefs,  
your inner thoughts, your whole existence  
And if there is a God then answer if you will  
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place  
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace  
  
If you could live your life again  
Would you change a thing or leave all the same  
If you had the chance again  
Would you change a thing at all  
When you look back at your past  
Can you say that you are proud of what we've done  
Are there times when you believe  
That the right you thought was wrong  
  
All of my life I have believed  
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me

389,Iron Maiden,Killers,"You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back  
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs  
  
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise  
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night  
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed  
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me  
  
I can see what a knife's meant to be  
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see  
  
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties  
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs  
  
Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night  
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light  
I have found you, and now there is no place to run  
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?  
Oh yeah, I've done it  
Yeah  
  
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back  
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack  
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed  
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs  
Oh look out, I'm coming for you

390,Iron Maiden,King Of Twilight,"Crying in the dark  
I've been trying, trying so hard  
I've been crying, crying in the dark  
Don't forsake me, the time of mine is near  
Don't ever break me and the world that brought me here  
  
Sick and lonely, waiting for you  
Sick and lonely, wondering what to do  
Can you hear me, when I say to you  
You give me your hand, I'll give mine to you  
  
King of twilight  
When the king of twilight shows me  
I will take ten steps to see  
Forty leaves I pay for freedom  
  
For a chance to be free  
For a chance to be free  
  
When the king of twilight calls you  
Take a step and you will see  
We all need a quick solution  
  
For a chance to be free  
For a chance to be free  
Free  
  
When the king of twilight shows me  
I will take ten steps to see  
Forty leaves I pay for freedom  
  
For a chance to be free  
For a chance to be  
Free

"
391,Iron Maiden,Lightning Strikes Twice,"I feel the breeze on my face in expectance  
Not very long before the storm reaches here  
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again  
Feel something strong as the power draws near  
  
Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you  
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear  
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone  
It takes me back to my childhood again  
  
And as I wait and I look for an answer  
To all the things going round in my head  
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when  
It's maybe threatening to happen again  
  
As the ominous light draws near  
There's a lone dog howls in the park  
All the people hurry inside  
As a lightning flash lights dark  
The storm is nearly here  
Only God will know  
  
You're sitting alone you watch  
As the wind is blowing treetops  
And the swaying rustling leaves  
Plenty of time to perceive  
As you wait for rain to fall  
Only God knows  
The whole sky glows  
  
Maybe lightning strikes twice  
Maybe lightning strikes twice

"
392,Iron Maiden,Look For The Truth,"All my dark dreams  
Drift like smoke in the breeze  
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep  
Here comes the nightmare that never ends  
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men  
  
In the house of my soul  
In rooms of ugliness and cold  
Memories locked away  
All the doubts and fears I never faced  
  
Now they come again  
I am falling down to meet with them  
fear within us all  
Mine awake and they stand up tall  
  
Look for the truth  
Deepest cut of all from you  
Knife of the truth  
Blade of hatred slicing through  
  
I pray my sleep will break  
Maybe this time I won't wake  
Weakness I hide so well  
This dagger in my mind will tell  
  
It's my final stand  
I make a fist out of each hand  
To the shadows of the past  
Take a breath and I scream attack

"
393,Iron Maiden,Lord Of Light,"There are secrets that you keep  
There are secrets that you keep  
There are secrets that you tell to me alone  
I can't reach things I can't see  
You don't see this strange world  
Quite the same as me  
Don't deny me what I am  
Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth  
These are things you can't reveal  
  
These are things you can't reveal  
  
We are part of some strange plan  
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man  
Infernal sacrifice of hell  
Fire breathing lead the way  
Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one  
Revenge is living in the past  
Time to look into a new millennium  
  
Spiral path leads through the maze  
Down into the fiery underworld below  
Fire breathing lead the way  
Lucifer was just an angel led astray  
  
[Chorus x2:]  
Free your soul and let it fly  
Give your life to the Lord of Light  
Keep your secrets and rain on me  
All I see are mysteries  
  
We are not worthy in your black  
And blazing eyes  
We gather demons in the mirror every day  
The bridge of darkness casts a  
Shadow on us all  
And all our sins to you we give this day  
  
Others wait their turn  
Their lives were meant to last  
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast  
Free your soul and let it fly  
Mine was caught I couldn't try  
Time returns again to punish all of us  
  
We are cast out by our bloody father's hand  
We are strangers in this lonely promised land  
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost  
In our nightmare world the only one we trust  
  
[Chorus x2]

"
394,Iron Maiden,Lord Of The Flies,"I don't care for this world anymore  
I just want to live my own fantasy  
Fate has brought us to these shores  
What was meant to be is now happening  
  
I've found that I like this living in danger  
Living on edge it makes feel as one  
Who cares now what's right or wrong,  
It's reality  
Killing so we survive  
Wherever we may roam  
Wherever we may hide  
We've got to get away  
  
I don't want existence to end  
We must prepare ourselves for the elements  
I just want to feel like we're strong  
We don't need a code of morality  
  
I like all the mixed emotion and anger  
It brings out the animal the power you can feel  
And feeling so high on this much adrenalin  
Excited but scary to believe what we've become  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something within us  
We are lord of flies  
  
Saints and sinners  
Something willing us  
To be lord of the flies

"
395,Iron Maiden,Man On The Edge,"The freeway is jammed  
And it's backed up for miles  
The car is an oven and baking is wild  
Nothing is ever the way it should be  
What we deserve we just don't get you see  
  
A briefcase, a lunch and a man on the edge  
Each step get closer to losing his head  
Is someone in heaven are they looking down  
Cause nothing is fair just you look around  
  
Falling down  
Falling down  
Falling down  
  
He's sick of waiting of lying like this  
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss  
Branded a leper because you don't fit  
In the land of the free  
You can't live by your wits  
  
Once he built missiles a nation's defence  
Now he can't even give birthday presents  
Across the city he leaves in his wake  
A glimpse of the future a cannibal state

"
396,Iron Maiden,Massacre,"At a point below zero  
There's no place left to go  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Were killed like sleeping buffalo  
  
Through the devil's canyon  
Across the battlefield  
Death has no companion  
The spirit is forced to yield  
  
There goes the bandolero  
Through the hole in the wall  
He's a coward but doesn't care though  
In fact, he doesn't care at all  
  
The general that's commanding  
He's defending what he fears  
While the troops they are depending  
On reinforcements from the rear  
  
If God is in the heavens  
How can this happen here?  
In His name, they used the weapons  
For the massacre  
  
There is a point below zero  
Where the sun can see the land  
Six hundred unknown heroes  
Lay dead in the sand

"
397,Iron Maiden,Montsegur,"I stand alone in this desolate space  
In death they are truly alive  
Massacred innocence, evil took place  
The angels were burning inside  
  
Centuries later I wonder why  
What secret they took to their grave  
Still burning heretics under our skies  
Religion's still burning inside  
  
[Chorus]  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
  
As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne  
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal  
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross  
  
Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis, to die and be free  
  
The book of Old Testament crippled and black  
Satan - his weapon is lust  
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh  
Back to the torture of lies  
  
The perfect ones willingly died at the stake  
And all of their followers slain  
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed  
Religion's still burning inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne  
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal  
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross  
  
Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on command  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
Still running herretics under our skies  
  
As we kill them all so God know his own  
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust  
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin  
No passover feast for the cursed within  
  
Facing the sun as they went to their grave  
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave  
Death is the price for your soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis and to die and be free  
  
[Chorus]

398,Iron Maiden,Moonchild,"Seven deadly sins  
Seven ways to win  
Seven holy paths to hell  
And your trip begins  
  
Seven downward slopes  
Seven bloodied hopes  
Seven are your burning fires  
Seven your desires  
  
I am he the born-less one  
The fallen angel watching you  
Babylon, the scarlet whore  
I'll infiltrate your gratitude  
Don't you dare to save your son  
Kill him now and save the young ones  
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe  
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
  
I count the heads of those unborn  
The accursed ones I'll find them all  
And if you die by your own hand  
As a suicide you shall be damned  
And if you try to save your soul  
I will torment you, you shall not grow old  
With every second and passing breath  
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child  
Moonchild take my hand tonight  
  
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night  
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite  
Seven angels seven demons battle for his soul  
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die  
  
One more dies one more lives  
One baby cries one mother grieves  
For all the sins you will commit  
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give  
A web of fear shall be your coat  
To clothe you in the night  
A lucky escape for you young man  
But I'll see you damned in endless night  
  
Moonchild hear the mandrake scream  
Moonchild open the seventh seal  
Moonchild you'll be mine soon child  
Moonchild take my hand tonight

399,Iron Maiden,Mother Russia,"Mother Russia how are you sleeping  
Middle winter cold winds blow  
From the trees the snowflakes drifting  
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow  
  
Mother Russia poetry majestic  
Tells the time of a great empire  
Turning round the old man ponders  
Reminiscing an age gone by  
  
Mother Russia  
Dance of the czars  
Hold up your heads  
Be proud of what you are  
Now it has come  
Freedom at last  
Turning the tides of history  
And your past  
  
Mother Russia  
Dance of the czars  
Hold up your heads  
Remember who you are  
Can you release  
The anger the grief  
Can you be happy  
Now your people are free

"
400,Iron Maiden,New Frontier,"Bleeding you dry from the start  
The sum of my parts  
To give it away  
New life in a day  
Some new Frankenstein  
Damned for all time  
  
Cursed by the angel who fell  
Who saves me from hell?  
And who is my god?  
And where is my soul?  
Too tired to jump too young to run  
  
[Bridge]  
Never ending, forever searching  
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart  
Always seeking, always asking  
Questions right from the start  
  
[Chorus:]  
Out beyond the new frontier  
Playing god without mercy, without fear  
Create a beast, made a man without a soul  
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man?  
Is it worth the risk, a war of god and man?  
  
I want to end my life now  
But I don't know how  
Recycled again a lifetime of pain  
The spawn of a man  
The devil has planned  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

"
401,Iron Maiden,No Prayer For The Dying,"There are times when I've wondered  
And times when I've cried  
When my prayers they were answered  
At times when I've lied  
But if you asked me a question  
Would I tell you truth  
Now there's something to bet on  
You've got nothing to lose  
  
When I've sat by the window  
And gazed at the rain  
With an ache in my heart  
But never feeling the pain  
And if you would tell me  
Just what my life means  
Walking a long road  
Never reaching the end  
  
God give me the answer to my life  
God give me the answer to my dreams  
God give me the answer to my prayers  
God give me the answer to my being

"
402,Iron Maiden,Only The Good Die Young,"The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night  
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed  
Time it waits for no man  
My future it is revealed  
Time it waits for no man  
My fate is sealed  
  
If I cancel tomorrow the undead will thank me today  
Fly in the face of your prophets I mock your morality plays  
The moon is red and bleeding  
The sun is burned and black  
The book of life is silent  
No turning back  
  
[Chorus:]  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Mystery madman a victim of cruel charade  
Some innocent pawn in an end game one more stalemate  
Is death another birthday?  
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?  
Do the undead live within us  
And look through our eyes?  
  
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust  
Measure your coffin does it measure up to your lust?  
So I think I'll leave you  
With your bishops and your guilt  
So until the next time  
Have a good sin  
  
[Chorus]  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
All the evil seem to live forever  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Seven deadly sins  
Seven ways to win  
Seven holy paths to hell  
  
Seven downward slopes  
Seven bloodied hopes  
Seven are your burning fires  
Seven your desires...

403,Iron Maiden,Paschendale,"In a foreign field he lay  
Lonely soldier, unknown grave  
On his dying words he prays  
Tell the world of Paschendale  
  
Relive all that he's been through  
Last communion of his soul  
Rust your bullets with his tears  
Let me tell you 'bout his years  
  
Laying low in a blood filled trench  
Kill Tim 'til my very own death  
On my face I can feel the falling rain  
Never see my friends again  
  
In the smoke, in the mud and lead  
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread  
Soon be time to go over the wall  
Rapid fire and the end of us all  
  
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire  
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire  
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb  
Be reunited with my dead friends soon  
  
Many soldiers eighteen years  
Drown in mud, no more tears  
Surely a war no-one can win  
Killing time about to begin  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
The bodies of ours and our foes  
The sea of death it overflows  
In no man's land, God only knows  
Into jaws of death we go  
  
Crucified as if on a cross  
Allied troops they mourn their loss  
German war propaganda machine  
Such before has never been seen  
  
Swear I heard the angels cry  
Pray to god no more may die  
So that people know the truth  
Tell the tale of Paschendale  
  
Cruelty has a human heart  
Every man does play his part  
Terror of the men we kill  
The human heart is hungry still  
  
I stand my ground for the very last time  
Gun is ready as I stand in line  
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow  
Rush of blood and over we go  
  
Blood is falling like the rain  
Its crimson cloak unveils again  
The sound of guns can't hide their shame  
And so we die on Paschendale  
  
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire  
Running straight at the cannon fire  
Running blind as I hold my breath  
Say a prayer symphony of death  
  
As we charge the enemy lines  
A burst of fire and we go down  
I choke a cry but no-one hears  
Fell the blood go down my throat  
  
Home, far away  
From the war, a chance to live again  
Home, far away  
But the war, no chance to live again  
  
See my spirit on the wind  
Across the lines, beyond the hill  
Friend and foe will meet again  
Those who died at Paschendale

404,Iron Maiden,Run To The Hills,"White man came across the sea  
He brought us pain and misery  
He killed our tribes he killed our creed  
He took our game for his own need  
  
We fought him hard we fought him well  
Out on the plains we gave him hell  
But many came too much for Cree  
Oh will we ever be set free?  
  
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes  
Galloping hard on the plains  
Chasing the redskins back to their holes  
Fighting them at their own game  
Murder for freedom the stab in the back  
Women and children are cowards attack  
  
Run to the hills, run for your lives  
Run to the hills, run for your lives  
  
Soldier blue in the barren wastes  
Hunting and killing their game  
Raping the women and wasting the men  
The only good Indians are tame  
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold  
Enslaving the young and destroying the old  
  
Run to the hills, run for your lives

405,Iron Maiden,Sea Of Madness,"Out in the street somebody's crying,  
Out in the night the fires burn,  
Maybe tonight somebody's crying,  
Reached the point of no return.  
  
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe,  
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave.  
  
Like the eagle and the dove,  
Fly so high on wings above,  
When all you see can only bring you sadness,  
Like a river we will flow,  
On towards the sea we go,  
When all you do can only bring you sadness,  
Out on the sea of madness.  
  
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling,  
Out in the dark there burns a dream,  
You got to hope when you are falling,  
To find the world that you have seen.  
  
Oh, my eyes they see but I can't believe,  
Oh, my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave.  
  
Like the eagle and the dove,  
Fly so high on wings above,  
When all you see can only bring you sadness,  
Like a river we will flow,  
On towards the sea we go,  
When all you do can only bring you sadness,  
Out on the sea of madness.  
  
It's madness,  
The sun don't shine  
On the sea of madness,  
There ain't no wind to fill your sails,  
Madness,  
When all you see can only bring you sadness  
On towards the sea we go

406,Iron Maiden,Sign Of The Cross,"Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Silhouettes stand against the sky  
One in front with a cross held high  
Come to wash my sins away  
  
Standing alone in the wind and rain  
Feeling the fear that is growing  
Sensing the change in the tide again  
Brought by the storm that is brewing  
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear  
Some of the doubt in the things you believe  
Now that your faith will be put to the test  
Nothing to do but await what is coming  
  
Why then is god still protecting me  
Even when I don't deserve it  
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength  
Some they would call it a penance  
Why am I meant to face this alone  
Asking the question time and again  
Praying to God won't keep me alive  
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise  
  
They'll be saying their prayers  
when the moment comes  
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day  
And the guilty'll bleed when the moment comes  
They'll be coming to claim,  
take your soul away  
  
The sign of the cross  
The name of the rose  
a fire in the sky  
The sign of the cross  
  
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame  
They'll be bringing us all immortality  
Holding communion so the world be blessed  
My creator my God'll lay my soul to rest  
  
Lost the love of heaven above  
Chose the lust of the earth below  
Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Came to wash my sins away

407,Iron Maiden,Space Station No 5,"Start, with the sun  
And move on out

And a new star is born  
Space and time makin' love

Oh what a time we had  
Living on the ground  
I've moved to station No. 5  
See you next time around,  
Next time around  
  
As far you want, as close as you need  
It's all in the mind, you know  
This old world hasn't really seen it's day  
It's here, time to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember when it was so clear  
We were young, but the memory still remains  
To pick fruit from a tree  
Fish from the seas  
Now nothing's left here, but the stains  
Well I can't cry no more  
Can only be glad  
There's other places we can be  
If the time suits you right  
I'm leaving tonight  
Come fly away with me  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Start, with the sun  
And move on out  
The future's in the skies above  
The heavens unfold  
A new star is born  
Space and time makin' love

408,Iron Maiden,The Angel And The Gambler,"Roll of the dice  
Take a spin of the wheel  
Out of your hands now  
So how do you feel  
But you're not gonna win  
You'd better go back again  
  
Do you feel lucky  
Or do you feel scared  
Take what luck brings  
And be Devil may care  
But you're down on your luck  
What will the next day bring  
  
Adrift on the ocean  
Afloat in a daydream  
Or lost in a maze  
Or blind in the haze  
So what does it matter  
So why don't you answer  
So why did you send  
An angel to mend  
  
Best make decisions  
Before it's too late  
Take all your chances  
Take hold of the reins  
A roll of the dice  
Ahead of the game again  
  
Nothing to lose  
But so much to gain  
A little danger  
It goes without saying  
But what do you care  
You're gonna go in the end  
Gate open to heaven  
  
Is ready and waytnig  
Or straight down to hell  
Can go there as well  
  
I'll suffer my craving  
My soul's not worth saving  
Sowhy don't you go  
Just leave well alone  
  
Don't you think I'm a savior  
Don't you think I could save you  
Don't you think I could save your life  
  
There's like a hunger  
That knocks on your door  
You've had a taste of it  
Still you want more  
You've made your mistakes  
Won't play it the same again  
  
You have been warned  
But still you plunge in  
You play high stakes  
But there's nothing to win  
You've only one life  
And so many things to learn  
  
The Angel on one side  
The Devil the other  
Which path do you take  
Decisions to make  
  
Arrive at the crossroads  
You know where you're going  
And what if you wait  
It may be too late

409,Iron Maiden,The Educated Fool,"I'm an educated fool  
So I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do  
About this awkward situation  
That's been forced down right upon me  
  
As I'm walking down into  
On my own into the valley of life  
Got a lifetime of experience  
Yeah I've got so much to give  
  
Open the page at chapter one  
Could this just be that life's just begun  
Forever within your darker thoughts Reflecting on everything you've been  
Taught  
  
Never felt this way before  
Seems that somebody's just opened the door  
To the book of life, or is it death!  
There's ever anyway out  
  
Someone's looking down on me  
To the very inner core of my soul  
They won't tell me what they see  
But I really want to know  
  
I want to leave my life on my own  
I want to lift the unturned stone  
I want to walk right into the fire  
I want to live out all my desires  
  
I want to go and see the fire burn  
I want to see and feel my world turn  
I want to know what more there's to learn  
I want to pass the point of no return  
  
Do you really want to be  
Just another one statistic or feel  
  
That you really should aspire  
That you really do deserve more  
  
Do you ever really fell  
That you have so much potential inside  
What you really have to give  
Could be realized so much more  
  
Time will flow  
And I will follow  
Time will go  
But I will follow  
  
I want to feel what life's like respond  
I want to meet my father beyond  
I want to walk right into the light  
I want to feel no fear but delight  
  
I want to leave my life on my own  
I want to lift the unturned stone  
I want to walk right into the fire  
I want to live out all my desires

410,Iron Maiden,The Fallen Angel,"Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game  
Demons are inside you and they're making their play  
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time  
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind

411,Iron Maiden,The Fugitive,"On a cold October morning  
As frost lay on the ground  
Waiting to make my move  
I make no sound  
  
Waiting for the mist to cover all around  
I carefully picked my time  
Then took the wall  
  
I'm sick and tired of running  
The hunger and the pain  
A stop to look about then off again  
  
Being at the wrong place  
And the wrong time  
Suspected of a hit that was my crime  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name  
  
Always looking 'round me  
Forever looking back  
I'll always be a target for attack  
  
Ever moving onwards  
Always on the run  
Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name  
  
Even if I find them  
And get to clear my name  
I know that things can never  
Be the same  
  
But if I ever prove  
My innocence some day  
I've got to get them all to make them pay  
  
I am a fugitive being hunted down  
Like game  
I am a fugitive but I've got to clear  
My name

"
412,Iron Maiden,The Legacy,"Tell you a thing  
That you ought to know  
Two minutes of your time  
Then on you go  
  
Tell tale of the men  
All dressed in black  
That most of them  
Not coming back  
  
Sent off to the war  
To play little games  
And on their return  
Can't name no names  
  
Some strange yellow gas  
Has played with their minds  
Has reddened their eyes  
Removed all the lies  
  
And strange as it sounds  
Death knows no bounds  
How many get well  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
You lie in your death bed now  
But what did you bring to the table  
Brought us only holy sin  
Utter trust is a deadly thing  
  
To the prayer of holy peace  
We didn't know what was lying underneath  
So how could we be such fools  
And to think that we thought you the answer  
  
I can't begin to understand in all the lies  
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes  
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow  
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now  
  
Tangled up in a web of lies  
Could have been a way to prophesise  
Unaware of the consequence  
Not aware of the secrets that you kept  
  
Nothing that we could believe  
To reveal the facade of faceless men  
Not a thing that we could foresee  
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome  
  
You had us all strung out with  
Promises of peace  
But all along you cover plan was to deceive  
Can it put to rights now only time will tell  
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well  
  
Left to all our golden sons  
All to pick up on the peace  
You could have given all of them  
A little chance, at least  
  
Take the world to a better place  
Given them all just a little hope  
Just think what a legacy  
You know, will leave  
  
We seem destined to live in fear  
And some that would say Armageddon is near  
But where there's a life while there's hope  
That man won't self destruct  
  
Why can't we treat our fellow men  
With more respect and a shake of their hands  
But anger and loathing is rife  
The death on all sides is  
Becoming a way of life  
  
We live in an uncertain world  
Fear understanding and ignorance  
Is leading to death  
Only the corpses are left  
For vultures that prey on their bones  
  
But some are just not wanting peace  
Their whole life is death and misery  
The only thing that they know  
Fight fire with fire life is cheap  
  
But if they do stop to think  
That man is teetering right on the brink  
But do you think that they care  
They benefit from death and pain and despair

With the wind,  
And the rain that's beating down on your back.  
Your heart's beating loud  
And goes on getting louder  
And goes on even more till the sound  
Is ringing in your head,  
With every step you tread,  
And every breath you take,  
Determination makes  
  
You run,  
Never stop,  
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop,  
Keep the pace,  
Hold the race,  
Your mind is getting clearer,  
You're over halfway there but the miles  
Just never seem to end  
As if you're in a dream,  
Not getting anywhere.  
It seems so futile.  
  
Run, on and on,  
Run, on and on,  
The loneliness of the long distance runner.  
  
I've got to keep running the course,  
I've got to keep running and win at all costs,  
I've got to keep going, be strong,  
Must be so determined and push myself on.  
  
Run over stiles, across fields,  
Turn to look at who's on your heels,  
Way ahead of the field,  
The line is getting nearer but do  
You want the glory that goes,  
You reach the final stretch,  
Ideals are just a trace,  
You feel like throwing the race,  
It's all so futile.  
  
Run, on and on,  
Run, on and on,  
The loneliness of the long distance runner.

Your are the keeper of the mystery in your hands  
  
Nomad, rider of the ancient east  
Nomad, rider that men know the least  
Nomad, where you come from no one knows  
Nomad, where you go to no one tells  
  
Undercover of the veil of your disguise

Others say that you have died and live again

415,Iron Maiden,The Number Of The Beast,"Woe to you, oh earth and sea  
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath  
Because he knows the time is short  
Let him who hath understanding  
Reckon the number of the beast  
For it is a human number  
Its number is six hundred and sixty six  
  
I left alone, my mind was blank, I needed time to think  
To get the memories from my mind  
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw  
That night was real and not just fantasy?  
  
Just what I saw in my old dreams  
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me  
'Cause in my dreams, it's always there  
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair  
  
Night was black, was no use holding back  
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?  
In the mist, dark figures move and twist  
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Hell and fire was spawned to be released  
  
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised  
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky  
In the night, the fires are burning bright  
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Sacrifice is going on tonight  
  
This can't go on, I must inform the law  
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?  
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes  
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
6 6 6, the one for you and me  
  
I'm coming back, I will return  
And I'll possess your body, and I'll make you burn  
I have the fire, I have the force  
I have the power to make my evil take its course

416,Iron Maiden,The Pilgrim,"The keys to death and hell  
The ailing kingdom doomed to fail  
The bonds of sin and heart will break  
The pilgrims course will take  
  
Quelling the devils might  
And ready for eternal fight  
Aching limbs and fainting soul  
Holy battles take their toll  
  
Liberty and hope divine  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell

Spirit holy life eternal  
Raise me up take me home

Deliver good from ill  
Clean the water clean our guilt  
With us do what you will  
  
Then will my judge appear  
Bear no false angel that I hear  
For only then I will confess  
To my eternal hell  
  
Now give us our holy sign  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell

It stays with me knowing that I walk alone  
Through the eyes of the future I see  
They don't even know what fear is  
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed

420,Iron Maiden,The Thin Line Between Love And Hate,"When a person turns to wrong, is it a want to be, belong?  
Part of things at any cost, at what price a life is lost  
  
At what point do we begin, fighter spirit a will to win  
But what makes a man decide, take the wrong or righteous road  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
We all like to put the blame on society these days  
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings  
  
Sometimes take just more than that to survive be good at heart  
There is evil in some of us no matter what will never change  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad  
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane  
  
At what age begin to learn of which way out we will turn  
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn  
  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad  
There's a grey place between black and white  
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever  
Heart will die, my soul will fly, and I will live forever  
  
I will hope, my soul will fly, so I will live forever

421,Iron Maiden,The Unbeliever,"When you start to take a look within  
Do you feel at ease with what you see  
Do you think you can have peace of mind  
And have self-belief or be satisfied  
  
Do you think you even like yourself  
Or really think you could be someone else  
Is there something that you'd rather be  
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see  
  
All my life I've run away  
All my life I've tried to hide away  
  
Fell the paranoia creeping in  
Like a cancer eating at the skin  
Do you feel you've lost your self esteem  
And your self respect, what can you expect  
  
All my life, I've run astray  
Let my faith, slip away  
All my life, I've run astray  
Allowed my faith, to drift away  
  
Are you scared to look inside your mind  
Are you worried just at what you'll find  
Do you really want to face the truth  
Does it matter now, what have you got to loose  
  
Try to release the anger from within  
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins  
Do you really care what people think  
Are you strong enough to release the guilt

Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light  
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death  
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

He can push his own boat as you set up off the track  
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same  
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame  
  
You watch the world exploding every single night  
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light  
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain  
The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again  
  
Your time will come, your time will come  
Your time will come, your time will come

Left behind the loved ones  
Waiting silent in the hall  
Where you're going lies adventure  
Others only dream of  
Red and green light this is real  
And so you go to war  
  
For the passion, for the glory  
For the memories for the money  
You're a soldier, for your country  
What's the difference, all the same  
  
Far away from the land of our birth  
We fly a flag in some foreign earth  
We sailed away like our fathers before  
These colors don't run, from cold bloody war  
  
There is no one that will save you  
Going down in flames  
No surrender certain death you  
Look it in the eye  
On the shores tyranny you  
Crashed a human wave  
Paying for my freedom with your  
Lonely unmarked graves  
  
For the passion, for the glory  
For the memories for the money  
You're a soldier, for your country  
What's the difference, all the same  
  
Far away from the land of our birth  
We fly a flag in some foreign earth  
We sailed away like our fathers before  
These colors don't run, from cold bloody war

Dream on brothers, while you can  
Dream on sister, I hope you find the one  
All of our lives, covered up quickly  
By the tides of time  
  
Spend your days full of emptiness  
Spend your years full of loneliness  
Wasting love, in a desperate caress  
Rolling shadows of night  
  
Dream on brothers, while you can  
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one  
All of our lives, covered up quickly  
By the tides of time  
  
Sands are flowing and the lines  
Are in your hand  
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the  
Desperate cry that tears the night

425,Iron Maiden,We Kill Everything,"In the hulking halls of hatred where the Master makes his throne  
Within the ""ass""-teroid belt where his body floats alone

The worm begins to turn  
All life he must now squander  
The universe must burn  
He plans eternal war, as the eternal way  
But there is a force - which he must now obey  
Time and the events within, chronicles of hate and sin  
Everything, it has a start, but the end is always the best part  
Our quest - to find the broken bits  
Put them back and make them fit  
And once that we have read the end

Sucked into the feeding hole  
Guts and giblets cascade down  
Rectal midgets, flattened ground  
Please pay attention to the plot  
As I kick out this monster's snot  
Splitting skulls and raking ribs,  
Trephinated drainage sieve  
Protruding mass of reeking bile  
Which forms infected booger pile  
Assemble now the tablet  
Hope that it's not Braille  
Bring forth now the Master  
So we can end this tale  
And we'll kill everything (x3)

Evaporate before time's storm  
And dedicate your life to porn  
And dedicate your life to porn

You think your god has a soul?  
I bare my bum to the heavens  
I think a head is a hole.

Why must we all grow up when we could just play and play?  
Good things in life are free - can't buy everything, that's true  
Only one thing wrong with that - what it don't buy I don't use  
  
Only thing I'm thinking of is ""Why are we all here?""  
There must be more to do at nights than drinking rotten beer  
The world's a very shady place, and you can't trust a soul  
""Grin and bear it"" seemed the thing, when it just gets a hold  
At a later date, it might come out a fright  
At a later date, I hope that you're alright  
  
Human beings are dangerous and they call me in the dark  
But everything gets twice as cold in marching for a lark  
There's loads of things I'd like to do if I could find the time  
Working really tires me and I think I'll turn to crime  
At a later date, I hope they start it soon  
At a later date, before we hit the moon  
  
I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all  
People make you feel your contributions are too small  
I just can't be bothered to make an effort here at all

Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,  
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,  
Watching her, these things she said,  
The times she cried,  
Too frail to wake this time.  
  
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,  
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,  
Avenues all lined with trees,  
Picture me and then you start watching,  
Watching forever, forever,  
Watching love grow, forever,  
Letting me know, forever.

433,Joy Division,Dead Souls,"Someone take these dreams away,  
That point me to another day,  
A duel of personalities,  
That stretch all true realities.  
  
That keep calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me.  
  
Where figures from the past stand tall,  
And mocking voices ring the halls.  
Imperialistic house of prayer,  
Conquistadors who took their share.  
  
That keep calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me.  
  
Calling me, calling me, calling me, calling me.  
  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
They keep calling me.

434,Joy Division,Ice Age,"I've seen the real atrocities,  
Buried in the sand,

While we stand holding hands.  
  
I'm living in the Ice age,  
I'm living in the Ice age,  
Nothing will hold,  
Nothing will fit,  
Into the cold,  
It's not an eclipse.  
Living in the Ice age,  
Living in the Ice age,  
Living in the Ice age.  
  
Searching for another way,  
Hide behind the door,  
We'll live in holes and disused shafts,  
Hopes for little more.

435,Joy Division,Insight,"Guess you dreams always end.  
They don't rise up, just descend,  
But I don't care anymore,  
I've lost the will to want more,  
I'm not afraid not at all,  
I watch them all as they fall,  
But I remember when we were young.  
  
Those with habits of waste,  
Their sense of style and good taste,  
Of making sure you were right,  
Hey don't you know you were right?  
I'm not afraid anymore,  
I keep my eyes on the door,  
But I remember.  
  
Tears of sadness for you,  
More upheaval for you,  
Reflects a moment in time,  
A special moment in time,  
Yeah we wasted our time,  
We didn't really have time,  
But we remember when we were young.  
  
And all God's angels beware,  
And all you judges beware,  
Sons of chance, take good care,  
For all the people not there,  
I'm not afraid anymore,  
I'm not afraid anymore,  
I'm not afraid anymore,  
Oh, I'm not afraid anymore.

"
436,Joy Division,Komakino,"This is the hour when the mysteries emerge.  
A strangeness so hard to reflect.  
A moment so moving, goes straight to your heart,  
The vision has never been met.  
The attraction is held like a weight deep inside,  
Something I'll never forget.  
  
The pattern is set, her reaction will start,  
Complete but rejected too soon.  
Looking ahead in the grip of each fear,  
Recalls the life that we knew.  
The shadow that stood by the side of the road,  
Always reminds me of you.  
  
How can I find the right way to control,  
All the conflicts inside, all the problems beside,  
As the questions arise, and the answers don't fit,  
Into my way of things,  
Into my way of things.

"
437,Joy Division,The Drawback,"Seen the troubles and the evils of this world  
I've seen the stretches between godliness and sin  
I've had the promise and confessions of true faith  
And the hypocrisy that always lies within  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
  
I've seen the products and the other world of waste  
I've seen the colour of corruption deep within  
I've seen them lose themselves in dignity and taste  
To see in black and white and through to black again  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, everything for you  
I've seen the troubles and the evils of this world  
I've seen the ones who can succeed but always lose  
I've seen what's left of poor technology and work  
And watched them dying as they leave their ship of fools  
And they left it for you, all of this for you  
And they left it for you, all of this for you

"
438,Joy Division,The Eternal,"Procession moves on, the shouting is over,  
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone.  
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables,  
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain.  
  
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden,  
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky,  
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment,  
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside.  
  
Cry like a child, though these years make me older,  
With children my time is so wastefully spent,  
A burden to keep, though their inner communion,  
Accept like a curse an unlucky deal.  
  
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden,  
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall,  
No words could explain, no actions determine,  
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall.

439,Joy Division,The Only Mistake,"Made the fatal mistake,  
Like I did once before,  
A tendency just to take,  
Til the purpose turned sour,  
  
Strain, take the strain, these days we love,  
Strain, take the strain, these days we love.  
  
Yeah, the only mistake was that you ran away,  
Avenues lined with trees, strangled words for the day,  
Yeah, the only mistake, like I made once before,  
Yeah, the only mistake, could have made it before.  
  
Strain, take the strain, these days we love,  
Strain, take the strain, these days we love.  
  
And the only mistake, led to rumours unfound,  
Led to pressures unknown, different feelings and sounds,  
Yeah, the only mistake, like I made once before,  
Yeah, the only mistake, could have made it before.

440,Joy Division,Transmission,"Radio, live transmission.  
Radio, live transmission.  
  
Listen to the silence, let it ring on.  
Eyes, dark grey lenses frightened of the sun.  
We would have a fine time living in the night,  
Left to blind destruction,  
Waiting for our sight.  
  
And we would go on as though nothing was wrong.  
And hide from these days we remained all alone.  
Staying in the same place, just staying out the time.  
Touching from a distance,  
Further all the time.  
  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.  
  
Well I could call out when the going gets tough.  
The things that we've learnt are no longer enough.  
No language, just sound, that's all we need know, to synchronise  
Love to the beat of the show.  
  
And we could dance.  
  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.  
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, to the radio.

To win the first time around

I pick all the faults  
Well I concede all the faith tests  
Just to stick in your throats  
  
Thirty one G, thirty one G, thirty one G  
  
I hung around in your soundtrack  
To mirror all that you've done  
To find the right side of reason  
To kill the three lies for one  
I can see all the cold facts  
I can see through your eyes  
All this talk made no contact  
No matter how hard we tried  
  
Thirty one G, thirty one G, thirty one G  
  
I can still hear the footsteps  
I can see only walls  
I slid into your man-traps  
With no hearing at all

Had to give up the fight  
Just to live in the past tense  
To make believe you were right

I'm never scared, but you're still daunting me  
'Cause I know what you're likely to say  
And I know that you'll get your own way  
  
And all I wanted to say was that I love you  
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true

Touch your heels heightening  
With it or hate it much more real  
And a permission I bare  
Standing so near me  
You put the fear of God in me  
Felt like the town was falling down  
And there you are  
With a face like that  
How couldn't I want you  
With a face like that  
Why wouldn't I fall in love with you

445,Pet Shop Boys,A Red Letter Day,"Go to work and take your calls  
Hang the fruits of your labour on the walls  
Such precision and care  
What does it matter  
If there's no one here to share  
The flowers in the garden the wine  
The Waiting for the Godot  
And so much modern time?  
All I want is what you want  
I'm always waiting for a red letter day  
The years perfecting a stance of  
Measured cool fade into insignificance  
The moment one starts to understand  
What on earth does it profit a man?  
All I want is what you want  
I'm always waiting for a red letter day  
For something special somehow new  
Someone saying ?I love you'  
Baby I'm waiting for the red letter day  
You can sneer or disappear behind a veneer  
Of self-control  
But for all of those who don't fit  
In who follow their instincts  
And are told they sin  
This is a prayer for a different way  
All I want is what you want  
I'm always waiting for a red letter day  
Like Christmas morning  
When you're a kid  
Admit you love me and you always did  
Baby I'm hoping for that red letter day today

For many different reasons  
So many tears will fall

Before it comes knocking at your door  
Before you know for sure  
This is what you were waiting for  
So many tears will haunt you  
Deny them or regret  
Some man will make you want to  
And you will not forget  
Before you find your love  
Before it comes knocking at your door  
Before you know for sure  
This is what you were waiting for  
There's a story of a man  
Who loved too much  
He ended up inside a prison cell  
You've got to want to give to get it  
Or you could land up  
In the same suspicious hell  
It's happened before, it's happened before  
Coincidence and patience  
Will mend this fatal flaw  
Though it may seem a long wait  
Others have been here  
Before you find your love  
Before it comes knocking at your door  
Before you know for sure  
This is what you were waiting for  
One day when the phone starts ringing  
You'll answer to the words  
You're longing for  
No tears no trade no prison cell  
Whatever you need  
He will return more  
It's happened before, it's happened before  

"
453,Pet Shop Boys,Being Boring,"I came across a cache of old photos  
And invitations to teenage parties  
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations  
From someone's wife, a famous writer  
In the nineteen-twenties  
When you're young you find inspiration  
In anyone who's ever gone  
And opened up a closing door  
She said: ""We were never feeling bored  
  
'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end""  
  
When I went I left from the station  
With a haversack and some trepidation  
Someone said: ""If you're not careful  
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for  
In the nineteen-seventies""  
But I sat back and looking forward  
My shoes were high and I had scored  
I'd bolted through a closing door  
I would never find myself feeling bored  
  
'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
We were always hoping that, looking back  
You could always rely on a friend  
  
Now I sit with different faces  
In rented rooms and foreign places  
All the people I was kissing  
Some are here and some are missing  
In the nineteen-nineties  
I never dreamt that I would get to be  
The creature that I always meant to be  
But I thought in spite of dreams  
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me  
  
'Cause we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""  
And we were never holding back or worried that  
Time would come to an end  
We were always hoping that, looking back  
You could always rely on a friend  
  
And we were never being boring  
We had too much time to find for ourselves  
And we were never being boring  
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""  
And we were never being boring  
We were never being bored

""Hands-off, you're just not good enough""

More attention everyday, so they say:

Well, that says maybe, in a way, but it's okay

They draw away, as if to say:  
""Who are these people anyway?  
How dare they confront us?""

I pause in the public place  
Take time from all the time it takes  
To make up for all the big mistakes  
I gotta get out, I gotta get out

And you need a little time  
If your muse is out of luck  
You might need an extra rhyme  
  
When your heart escapes your head downways  
In the growing queue that life creates  
  
I stop for some breathing space  
Divert from the public place  
Return to a private place  
I know it's the adjusting case  
I gotta get out, I gotta get out  
  
Far far away I'm going  
Far far away I gotta get out  
I gotta get out  
  
There's a place beyond this world  
Where the mountains meet the sky  
It's a different state of mind  
Like a dream where you can fly  
  
Can I tell you this in confidence  
I need to regain that whole indoor sense

Divert from the public place

Too late to sleep, too soon to rise  
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?  
Hot and feverish you face the fact  
  
You're in love, and it feels like shame  
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again  
You're in love, and it feels like pain  
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims  
  
So ask yourself now, can you forgive her

Ask yourself, can you even deliver

Makes the definitive collection

To live in hope

Without this fear?

And carrying on as normal  
  
Hay una discoteca por acqui?  
  
Te quiero  
Entiende usted?  
Digame  
Cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar?

Remember when we felt the sun,  
A love like paradise,  
How hot it burned,  
A threat of distant thunder,  
The sky was red,  
And where you walked you always,  
Turned ev'ry head  
  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,  
All day, all day, Domino dancing,  
  
I thought that when we fought  
I was to blame,  
But now I know you play,  
A different game,  
I've seen you dance with danger,  
Still wanting more,  
Add another number, To the score  
  
All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,  
All day, all day, Domino dancing,  
When you look around you wonder  
Do you play to win or are you just a bad loser?

I don't know why, I don't know how,  
I thought I loved you but, I'm not sure now,  
I hear the thunder crashing, The sky is dark,  
And now a storm is breaking, Within my heart.

Wrapped in my invisibility cloak?  
Well, quite.

I never knew time pass so slow  
I wish I'd never met you, or that I could bear to let you go  
At dead of night, 'till break of day  
Endless thoughts and questions keep me awake  
It's much too late  
  
Where've you been?  
Who've you seen?  
You didn't phone when you said you would!  
Do you lie?  
Do you try  
To keep in touch? You know you could  
I've tried to see your point of view  
But could not hear or see  
For jealousy  
Where've you been?  
Who've you seen?  
You didn't phone when you said you would!  
Do you lie?  
Do you try  
To keep in touch? You know you could  
I've tried to see your point of view

You wait 'till later  
'Till later tonight  
You wait 'till later, 'till later  
'Till later tonight  
  
That boy never cast a look in your direction  
Never tried to hook for your affection  
Dresses like the mod of your invention, tall and proud  
He is the head boy of the school of thought  
That plays in your intentions, night and day

Cause tonight always comes

489,Pet Shop Boys,Miserablism,"It seems to me there's something serious beginning  
A new approach found to the meaning of life  
Deny that happiness is open as an option  
And disappointment disappears over night  
  
Say that love is an impossible dream  
Face the facts, that's what it's always been  
Relax, what you see is what you've seen  
What you get, is a new philosophy  
  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
  
Meanwhile your life is still directed as a drama  
With realism on the sparsest of sets  
Every performance tends to reach the same conclusion  
No happy endings but a message to depress  
Saying life is an impossible scheme  
That's the point of this philosophy  
  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
  
But if is wasn't, and isn't were  
You can't be sure, but you might find ecstasy  
  
(Oh no)  
  
Just for the sake of it, make sure you're always frowning  
(Get, get, get)  
It shows the world that you've got substance and depth  
You know, life is an impossible scheme  
And love an imperceptible dream  
  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
(That's what you got, that's what you get)  
  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserablism, is is and isn't isn't  
Miserable

490,Pet Shop Boys,Only The Wind,"It's only the wind blowing litter all around  
Just a little wind and the trees are falling down  
There's nobody crying, that was yesterday  
Inside we're all smiling, everything's okay  
  
It's only the wind blowing cans along the street  
Someone's dustbin lid playing havoc with the peace  
There's nobody hiding behind a locked door  
And no one's been lying, 'cause we don't lie any more  
  
It's only the wind, how it takes you by surprise  
Suddenly begins, then before you know it dies  
My hands are not shaking, I don't touch a drop  
You must be mistaken, I know when to stop  
  
When life is karma, I have no doubt  
No angry drama, a storm blows itself out  
  
It's only the wind, they say it's getting worse  
The trouble that it brings haunts us like a curse  
My nerves are all jangled, but I'm pulling through  
I hope I can handle what I have to do  
  
When life is karma, I have no doubt  
No angry drama, a storm blows itself out  
A storm blows itself out...  
  
I'm sorry

491,Pet Shop Boys,Positive Role Model,"Here we are  
where we were

So much for making it day by day  
Back on everything  
Instead of taking another way  
we're back on everything  
  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model  
  
My reflection on the street  
Is that the way I walk?  
Introspection as I speak  
I need to change the way I talk  
In a changing world  
there's so much you could be  
Why can't you choose your self  
like your enemy?  
Have you ever imagined  
a new you?  
I could be someone else  
Somebody new  
  
Reinvention:  
my intention  
  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model  
I want a positive role model

Stupid fears

Radiophonic  
I think I'm in love  
  
My skin is itching  
I'm totally twitching  
With the pounding in my head  
Like a dub sub-sonic beat-box  
Booming bass under the bed  
My hands are shaking  
My mind is aching  
With a feeling deep inside  
That you've been staring  
Sending signals  
Every time our paths collide

You don't understand it's the glamorous life

If it's just a prison, I'm locked in it too  
I tried to leave you, but after all that we had said  
I went to pieces when I should have shouted and screamed  
instead:  
So sorry, I said  
Your powers of persuasion, those quizzical eyes  
Have tired and tied me, with innocent guile  
I would have walked out, and after all the tears we shed  
I should have stalked out, gone and painted the town bright  
red  
But instead  
So sorry, I said  
How tough it gets, don't talk to me about it!  
To pay off your debts, I worked on overtime  
And you say you never believed in luck  
If you need a reason, consider me mad  
An old retainer, loyal and sad  
I bought my freedom, but after all that we had shared  
I couldn't leave you think of the skins I'd have to shed  
instead  
So sorry, I said  
So sorry, I said  
So sorry, I said

498,Pet Shop Boys,The End Of The World,"Floods of tears and doors slamming  
Stamping feet across the landing  
Because of your obligation  
To stay home and fight  
Sitting down to a composition  
Test the limits of your inhibition  
If the phone hasn't rung by midnight  
It's over tonight  
  
If someone tried, you'd realise  
It's just a boy or a girl  
It's not the end of the world  
  
Piles of toast and broken promises  
Among the books and pens and reading glasses  
It seems there's no escape from the humdrum  
It's over and done  
  
If someone tried, you'd realise  
It's just a boy or a girl  
It's not the end of the world  
If someone cried, you'd sympathise  
It's just a boy or a girl  
It's not the end of the world  
  
At midnight in desperation  
Imagine total teenage destruction  
  
The Prophets all predicted extinction  
The Virgin spoke in apparitions  
And if it all came to pass now  
You feel we'd all deserve it somehow  
  
But if someone tried (you'd realise)  
You'd realise (and sympathize)  
It's just a boy or a girl  
It's not the end of the world  
If someone cried (you'd sympathize)  
You'd sympathise (and realise)

What's that noise over there?  
Is it corrugated iron they're hitting?  
No, no, it's perfectly normal

Whose side are you on anyway?  
Is that some kind of threat?  
Well, I suppose it'll have to do  
As long as you don't make too much mess  
And would the last person to leave  
Once you've all finished kissing  
Turn the video on to record  
You never know what you're missing  
Bread and circuses and maybe later

Their journey done  
I look at my short life  
And think of all the champagne  
That I drink  
With all the faces I know  
And how much further can one go?  
And if I decide to step aside  
I will try to replay  
To the feelings I hide  
I look from my window  
Down to the square  
At workers still queuing there  
For market forces to provide  
What history's so far denied  
For a different kind of fate  
Than to labour long and always wait  
And if I decide to step aside  
I will try to return  
To the person inside  
Will I always need you?  
Would you want me to?  
Can you love me for good  
The way you thought you could?  
Or will spring bring rain  
And summer burn?  
Will tears at last precede  
The turn from summer warmth  
To sudden cold  
As certainly as growing old?  
And if I decide to step aside  
I will try to forget all the tears  
I'll have cried

You know I can't ever  
Bear to seem weak  
Or have any doubts  
That's just my technique  
I put in the hours  
At least I don't shirk  
A little bravado  
Does much of the work  
  
I am no one's  
Stepping stone  
But I couldn't live life  
In private  
Alone  
  
You may think I'm strong  
And I can do no wrong  
But I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
I may be hard to take  
But you can call me fake  
'cause I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
At night  
I am lying awake  
Through the hours trying  
To calculate  
Am I good enough?  
Could I contrive?  
To keep this sham around  
Will I survive?  
  
I know you must sometimes  
Think I don't care  
Or even appreciate  
What we share  
  
Though I'm no one's  
Stepping stone  
The truth is I love you  
And I'd go crazy  
Alone  
  
You may think I'm strong  
And I can do no wrong  
But I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
I may be hard to take  
But you can call me fake  
'cause I'm vulnerable  
So vulnerable  
Without you  
  
So vulnerable without you

506,Pet Shop Boys,What Keeps Mankind Alive?,"You gentlemen who think you have a mission  
To purge us of the seven deadly sins  
Should first sort out the basic food position  
Then start your preaching, that's where it begins  
  
You lot, who preach restraint and watch your waist as well  
Should learn for all time how the world is run  
However much you twist, whatever lies you tell  
Food is the first thing, morals follow on  
  
[Chorus]  
So first make sure that those, who now are starving  
Get proper helpings, when we all start carving  
What keeps mankind alive, the fact that millions  
Are daily tortured, stifled, punished, silenced, oppressed  
Mankind can keep alive, thanks to its brilliance  
At keeping its humanity repressed  
For once, you must not try to shirk the facts  
Mankind is kept alive by bestial acts  
  
You say the girls may strip with your permission  
You draw the line dividing art from sin  
So first sort out the basic food position  
Then start your preaching, that's where it begins  
  
You lot, who bank on your desires and our disgust  
Should learn for all time how the world is run  
Whatever lies you tell, however much you twist  
Food is the first thing, morals follow on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mankind can keep alive, thanks to its brilliance  
At keeping its humanity repressed  
For once, you must not try to shirk the facts  
Mankind is kept alive by bestial acts

I want to hide  
I want to break down the walls the hold me inside  
I want to reach out  
And touch the flame  
Where the streets have no name

The sun on my face  
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace  
I want to take shelter from poison rain  
Where the streets have no name

We're still building and burning down love  
Burning down love  
And when I go there

Where the streets have no name

Our love turns to rust  
We're beaten and blown by the wind  
Trampled in dust  
I'll show you a place  
High on a desert plain  
Where the streets have no name  
  
Where the streets have no name  
Where the streets have no name  
  
We're still building and burning down love  
Burning down love

You know where you went wrong  
You know where you went wrong

No one shakes his hand  
He don't understand

Of every boy and every girl  
Who don't understand what's going on anymore

Who don't understand what's going on anymore

One looks, the other laughs

Why did I change my mind?  
Then hands on hips  
The other girl says: Admit! Admit!

She took so much out of his  
It was a crucial assignment  
No one ever asked for this  
It was a little confusin'  
He thought, he knew what to do  
But now they're walkin' in silence  
Little girl and soldier blue  
Well, she wrote you a song, sayin' that she approved  
But you didn't understand  
And when love comes along, it's just a catcher in the rye  
It's hard to make those long term plans  
Well, it's the code of love  
You don't understand her  
Well, it's the code of love  
You could never ask for more  
You could never ask for more  
They made a certain agreement  
He's bound to do what he's told  
He ran back home with the message  
Screwed up in a pocket cold  
She sat at home with her reason  
A sour note and a tear  
But love comes home for the season  
Breakin' down the walls of fears  
Well, she wrote you a song sayin' that she approved  
But you didn't understand  
And when love comes along, it's just a catcher in the rye  
It's hard to make those long term plans

510,Spandau Ballet,Crashed Into Love,"We stand alone  
Warmed by the light that reflects in your eyes  
I feel inside an emotional storm  
And a heart like a sky  
This moment takes to somewhere unknown  
And what I'm feeling is thrilled to the bone  
Been chasing rainbows all of my life  
Now I know that was wrong  
I've found the gold deep in my soul  
And I want to hang on  
Just one look of encouragement  
And what I have here is heaven sent  
And hit from above  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I'm feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide, this can't be denied  
And now it hits me, love overdrive  
I try to stand my ground but I can't contrive  
These are the days that we'll think that we dreamed  
For the rest of our lives  
This moment takes to somewhere unknown  
And what I'm feeling is thrilled to the bone  
And hit from above  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I'm feeling that when powers inside  
When forces collide, this can't be denied  
I just crashed into love, crashed into love  
And I know that I was hit by surprise  
Between open eyes, emotions arise  
And now we're living the June of our lives  
In the heat of the day  
We're on the eve of experience now  
And nothing will take away  
Crashed into love  
Crashed into love  
Just one look of encouragement  
And what I have here is heaven sent  
And sent from above

Conceiving new idea

Paint me in the home  
All the boys with framed dimension  
A cover up on lust

Obsession dies alone with tragedy

A passion course that leads to pain  
An acid taste that laced her soul again  
She loved like diamond  
She loved like diamond  
And cut so hard, she died  
Another path, I've run them all  
The rain has cleared the stains, no trace at all

And cut so hard, she died  
She loved like diamond  
She loved like diamond  
And cut so hard, she died

That you could ever know  
With the moon and the tide I'm drawn to your side  
And moving with the flow  
When it's time to choose and it's sink or swim,  
I know I'll drown this time  
When the cold wind blows and I'm falling in,  
Throw the line  
Now I'm swept,  
And I'm lost within my mind  
On a love that makes me blind  
And this feeling I just can't forget,  
Now I'm swept  
On a tide that's in my soul  
And this feeling that I have is losing me control  
And I hope it doesn't end just yet,  
Now I'm swept  
Mind over matter,  
No matter where this mind will be  
There's more to be said, oh, for games in the head  
Than anything you'll ever see  
There's safety in dreaming,  
So wrap me in things that I know  
With my head in the sand,  
I'm at your command  
And moving with the flow  
When it's time to choose and it's sink or swim,  
I know I'll drown this time  
When the cold wind blows and I'm falling in,  
Throw the line  
Now I'm swept,  
And I'm lost within my mind  
On a love that makes me blind  
And this feeling I just can't forget,

On a tide that's in my soul  
And this feeling that I have is losing me control

514,Spandau Ballet,Through The Barricades,"Mother doesn't know where love has gone  
She says it must be youth  
That keeps us feeeling strong  
See it in her face, that's turned to ice  
And when she smiles she shows  
The lines of sacrifice  
And now I know what they're saying  
When the sun begins to fade  
And we made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Father made my history  
He fought for what he thought  
Would set us somehow free  
He tought me what to say in school  
I learned off by heart  
But now that's torn in two  
And now I know what they're saying  
In the music of the parade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Born on different sides of life  
We feel the same  
And feel all of this strife  
So come to me when I'm asleep  
We'll cross the line  
And dance upon the street  
And now I know what they're saying  
When the drums begin to fade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Oh, turn around and I'll be there  
There's a scar through my heart  
But I'll bare it again  
I thought we were the human race  
But we were just another border-line-case  
And the stars reach down and tell us  
That there's always one escape  
I don't know where love has gone  
And in this trouble land  
Desperation keep us strong  
Fridays child is full of soul  
With nothing left to lose  
There's everything to go  
And now I know what they're are saying  
It's a terrible beauty we've made  
So we make our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Now I know what they're are saying  
As hearts go to their graves  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades.

years away from fighting

I am beautiful and clean  
and so very very young  
to be standing in the street  
to be taken by someone  
Questions questions

to cut a long story short

Dark is my night  
Now she has left me  
I'm doing time  
In this prison of a heart  
Where I've fallen apart and cried  
On to the table  
Where she threw her ring  
Slamming her goodbyes  
She took everything  
Now that the jack has  
Beaten the king  
In this opera of old soap  
There has got to be some new hope  
That I'll win  
  
Break my heart  
Snap my feelings  
Break my heart  
Walk out and see  
There are more fish in the ocean  
But somehow they're not for me  
  
Caught with another  
And reasons there are  
She needs attention  
When I'm at the bar  
Now there's another  
That's safe in her arms  
And if that's not understood  
Then I guess that you should  
Break my heart

520,Squeeze,Crying In My Sleep,"Breaking up

Is showing me the door  
And if I get it open  
I'll discover that there's much more to life than this  
As I hit the wall with the full force of my fist  
I concede this time to defeat  
I keep crying in my sleep  
Dear boy, poor boy  
I keep crying in my sleep  
  
Breaking up  
Is making me see  
Inside myself again  
And if I can keep looking  
Inside then I might change the things that I fear  
It keeps my heart awake and stops the tears.  
My nights are incomplete  
I keep crying in my sleep  
  
The sound of her voice  
The sound of her words  
I hear every breath  
Each whisper is heard  
But it's so hard now  
Now she is gone  
Everything I did I did wrong  
I keep crying in my sleep  
  
And if I turn full circle  
Perhaps I'll see that the road ahead is clear  
When the world that's on my shoulder disappears.  
At night the footsteps creak  
I keep crying in my sleep

522,Squeeze,Domino,"I knew that I had drunk too much  
I had passed my drink degree  
I climbed into my rented car  
I was happy as could be  
  
Then I pulled out of the driveway  
And the lights began to blur  
Within a mile the car was stopped  
By a police officer - she said  
  
""Did you see the light was red?  
Did you see the light at all?""  
Then I fell into her open arm  
And that's all that I recall  
  
I knew that I had danced before  
But it never made the news  
Surprised to find my two left feet  
In John Travolta's shoes  
  
I hogged the space around a girl  
I found so full of verve  
Then I moved in slowly for the kill  
And watched her body swerve,  
  
She said ""did you know I'm not impressed  
With the way you dance at all""  
Then I fell into her open arms  
And that's all that I recall  
  
Blacked out and wasted  
I had to be persuaded  
With my view a little jaded  
That I was about to go  
  
Down like a domino  
  
I knew that I had said too much  
But tact was not my way  
Tears were on her bottom lip  
She had nothing more to say except  
  
""Did you know this love we have  
Has made me feel so small""  
Then I fell into her open arms  
And that's all that I recall

523,Squeeze,Donkey Talk,"Donkey talk  
I can hear the donkey talk  
Words chained out in a line  
Loads of reason not much rhyme  
Finger drumming beats behind  
Donkey talk most of the time  
The conversation peters out  
So you stare down at your shoes  
There's not much more to talk about  
When the silence is confused  
Then our eyes suddenly meet  
And we choose to look away  
That's just where we are today  
  
There's no sense in hanging round  
But we stand there all the same  
You find a verb I pluck a noun  
As the patience starts to strain  
Then our words suddenly clash  
As if there's so much to say  
That's just where we are today  
  
We used to stay up all night  
With our eyes all bloodshot and wonky  
We would hold each other tight  
And talk the back legs off a donkey  
But now I'm wearing its hat  
We can't even laugh at that

"
524,Squeeze,Dr. Jazz,"Give me iko  
I want to ball the wall here  
Shuffle in Dumaine  
Hear the hookacumbi  
  
Meet my tipatina  
Love her hold her tightly  
Want to see her swaying  
In New Orleans nightly  
  
You know I want to be there  
Drinking in the morning  
Holler in the evening  
Dr. Jazz Dr. Jazz  
  
Bake my jelly roll  
You quicken my pulse  
You make my rhythm slow  
Crawfish gumbo  
  
Rhythm from the jungle  
Big chief rocking  
I follow the voodoo king  
Oolamalawaladollar  
  
That's what the fez he sing  
  
How long must it be  
How long must I wait  
Till Highway 49 takes me to your gate  
I eat a bowl of gumbo  
  
That Creole child will serve  
Sit on the verandah  
Happy in a Dixie world  
  
Maybe on Sunday  
Head for Baton Rouge  
Dancing with the Cajun  
Twist away my blues  
  
Then a drop of rain  
A trickle in my eye  
I look up and smile  
At the rhythm that never, never dies

"
525,Squeeze,Everything In The World,"There are planes coming in  
And there's planes going out  
One piece of luggage  
Goes around and round  
A lady cleans the floors  
A night guard checks his watch  
There's two lonely faces  
And one of them's the clock  
What crumbs of joy can I steal from this day  
She didn't have the time to call me and say  
If the things I'd heard were valid and true  
I've got everything in the world but you  
Everything in the world but you  
  
I drive against traffic  
People race in to work  
I've got this expression  
That I know I deserve  
The key slides in the lock  
Who's been here in my bed  
Who's been drinking coffee  
What's this paper and pen  
  
My nerves are ripped to shreds  
The phone rings on the floor  
But I can't pick it up  
I can't take any more  
There are planes flying in  
And there are planes flying out  
I look up to the sky  
And I'm left in no doubt

"
526,Squeeze,Fingertips,"You infiltrate my every hour  
You bug me like a flea  
I only wish I had the power  
To cut you free of me  
Like some crustacean on my hull  
You stick with me and make life dull  
How can I make you see  
I'm in love with you  
You typify the things to me  
That I no longer do  
So get a grip and let me be  
And my life will improve  
Leave me alone, get off my case  
You're always there right in my face  
But that is nothing new  
I'm so in love with you  
  
It's funny how I loved you like  
The bottle at my lips  
And when I fell off of my bike  
My life had been eclipsed  
By all the grief and disbelief there at your finger  
At your fingertips  
  
You hoover up the very words  
I choose to throw away  
I know some people never learn  
So how can I complain  
You hiss at me and make me shake  
Like some old grumpy rattlesnake  
Let's think this through again  
I'm so in love with you

"
527,Squeeze,Gone To The Dogs,"Down at the dogs the bets are placed  
A wad of notes rolled in a hand  
The floodlit track is center stage  
For winning hounds to take the stand  
In old covert coats and trilby hats  
The owners swan around the place  
The tic tac man throws out his arms  
His thin moustache stretched on his face  
  
Gone to the dogs the man and his life  
He stands by the rail and looks at the sky  
Confused by the thoughts  
That stew in his mind  
Alone by the track on a Saturday night  
  
Gone to the dogs  
He stands and reflects  
Gone to the dogs  
And has no regrets  
  
The restaurant's full and table bets  
Are taken by the girls who serve  
The basket meals and German wine  
Excitement mounts  
The buzz is heard  
The stadium is full of screams  
And cigar smoke is in the air  
The dogs race around on their last lap  
And down the straight they chase the hare

"
528,Squeeze,Goodbye Girl,"I met her in a poolroom  
Her name I didn't catch  
She looks like something special  
The kind who'd understand  
The room was almost spinning  
She pulled another smile  
She had the grace like pleasure  
She had a certain style  
  
Sunlight on the lino  
Woke me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
  
She took me to a motel  
A room on the second floor  
A kettle and two coffees  
A number on the door  
She said I hardly know you  
Agreed we kissed goodnight  
I knew that in the morning  
Somehow I'd wake to find  
  
Sunlight on the lino  
Wakening me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
  
I lost my silver razor  
My clubroom locker keys  
The money in the waistcoat  
It doesn't bother me  
My wife has moved to Jersey  
So mud is not the word  
If you ever see her  
Say hello goodbye girl  
  
Sunlight on the lino  
Woke me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl

"
529,Squeeze,Got To Me,"(wilkinson)  
Love is the liar that no one can blame  
Everyone knows how it feels  
All of us given to lose or to gain  
So I won't question your reasons for keeping me  
Keeping me here now it's late  
Taking your time, making sure of mine  
Looking for something to say  
That would further your nervous design  
Wish I could tell you that I feel the same  
And it's keeping me here now it's late  
I believe you got to me and you know it  
I believe you won't let go  
I believe you got to me  
I know that you feel it too  
Got to me, got to you  
Looking at you sitting looking at me  
Feeling the night slip away  
To the morning away to the day  
Let it stay sleeping, nothing can keep me  
Away from you now that it's late  
I believe you got to me and you know it  
I believe you won't let go  
I believe you got to me, can you show it  
If you can then he has to know  
I believe you got to me  
I know that you feel it too  
Got to me, got to you  

"
530,Squeeze,Great Escape,"Sitting there at home, he arrived home late  
With no more blood cells to inebriate  
He lunged at her there, she fell from the couch  
He grabbed her body as he pulled her down  
She was screaming no, kicking out at him  
But he weighed a ton, she could never win  
He fell down on her like a sack of snakes  
Tears fell from her face as she cried and cried  
When there's hope, when there's fear  
What is there to say that he might hear  
You turn him down with no mistake  
Now you're leaving, the great escape  
  
She ran from the room out of their back door  
Leaving him to sleep on the front room floor  
And she walked that night to the town hall square  
She knew it was through and she didn't care  
She stood up to him, he looked down on her  
He shot the message and the messenger  
When he woke he was sick with all the shame  
Tears fell from his face as she cried and cried  
  
She arrived back home, he was on his knees  
Begging with his heart please come back to me

"
531,Squeeze,Grouch Of The Day,"I feel my chin hit my chest  
As I do my best to stay calm  
I feel my face start to ache  
As I try to shake the alarm  
As I roll on my side  
There's a smile on her face  
That says much more than words ever will  
About how she maintains all the spirit she's gained  
When I'm grouch of the day  
When I've drifted away  
And I'm moping around in a sulk  
She'll have something to say  
And I usually obey  
Then I get my resentments in bulk  
That's the price that you pay  
For being grouch of the day  
  
As my legs start to shake  
The feeling is great and I'm gone  
I feel butterflies wing  
As she starts to sling music on  
As she rolls on her back  
With her smile full of charm  
That says much more than words ever will  
About how the delight of her good time tonight  
Makes me look like I'm over the hill  
Her beauty erodes  
The desperate loads  
Of pressure that fills up my day  
With one smile all the stress melts away

"
532,Squeeze,Hard To Find,"I tried to tie you to the bed saliva at my lips  
I made it look so comfortable but could not feel to grip  
Your eyelids flickered with surprise as suddenly you saw  
Your hands and feet all bound and gagged and me out on the floor  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets so hard  
  
I tried to dance around the room in ballerina tights  
With music from the Valkyries and dimmers on my lights  
You tapped your feet and said that I should take another twirl  
You said that I would be so good if I was just a girl  
  
I try to touch you with a song arouse you with some grapes  
Enchant you with some lavender but this was my mistake  
'Cause you prefer to move around to play at postman's knock  
I'd like to see your sails go up the face smile on your clock

"
533,Squeeze,Images Of Loving,"Your initials on the singles  
That you chose to leave behind  
Sit in my collection  
They get played from time to time  
Left to remind me of something I'd forgot  
The images of loving before I lost the plot  
What was love to us  
Just sensation  
What was love to us  
The invitation  
To sit on my bed stand by a tree  
What were we feeling  
What was love to us  
  
The stagecoach would get held up  
On a Sunday afternoon  
We're dozing by the TV  
On a sofa with no room  
No room to lay out flat with her there by my side  
One eye on her movements one eye on Rawhide  
  
I just wasn't made for these times  
Spun around my record deck  
How green was my valley  
How blue the eyes that wept  
Looking back I don't think that I really cared  
This was my first lesson with nothing to compare

"
534,Squeeze,Little King,"When the little king  
Rode on his horse  
Into the darkened wood  
No one believed  
That he'd return  
They thought he'd gone for good  
As he looked down to see the lake  
He found a secret key  
The little king he couldn't wait  
And he rode off nervously  
In a stolen car  
On busy streets  
He spun the leather wheel  
He was burning oil  
In second gear  
As the tyres loudly squealed  
And the bouncers on the kerb  
Jumped right out of the way  
He smashed into a superstore  
And he didn't feel a thing  
Just a quiet night where the fun begins  
For the little king  
Once life was merry going round  
Then time began to rub  
The future looked as clear as day  
But it quickly turned to mud  
It stuck to him like glue  
What can anybody do  
For the little king  
For the little king  
Now the little king  
Is locked away  
To mix with the elite  
In the doghouse now  
He learns new tricks  
From other pedigrees  
It's small town front page news  
The fairy tale your king  
Has scratched his head looking for clues  
He found splinters there  
But one day soon the latch will swing  
For the little king

"
535,Squeeze,Long Face,"I'd lost the plot and roamed around  
Looked in the shops and hit the town  
My head was stuffed with words and aches  
I felt so rough and out of shape  
The clouds puffed up like bags of sweets  
That's just my luck, I couldn't eat  
My guts were full of churning fear  
With so much bull I had to clear  
When she said stuff yourself, don't be a clown  
Paint your wagon and take yourself right out of town  
What's this long face that keeps on  
Hanging around  
  
She wouldn't say, I couldn't tell  
Was this the day I'd go to hell  
I sulked around in such a mood  
Until I found the one I'd screwed  
And then it came as clear as mud  
I was the pain that boiled the blood  
And saw the faults where there were none  
Deep in the vaults where love begun  
  
When she said stuff yourself, don't be a clown  
Paint your wagon and take yourself right out of town  
What's this long face that keeps on  
Hanging around  
Then she said get a grip and shake this mood  
Get a life and find yourself some attitude  
What's this long face that keeps on  
Hanging around

"
536,Squeeze,Lost For Words,"I'm lost for words which is strange for me  
Stretched out like elastic bands  
I'm lost for words and no longer see  
Why they've slipped right through my hands  
What a lunch you made  
With a stew so thick  
That I was afraid  
I might chew a brick  
Then I talked to you  
With my flapping tongue  
Choking on my words  
  
I'm lost for words in the letters I write  
Smudged with a bleeding pen  
I'm lost for words that I never liked  
But I want to use my  
Abandoned words which is strange for me  
Stretched out like elastic bands  
I'm lost for words and no longer see  
Why they've slipped right through my hands

"
537,Squeeze,Melody Motel,"He drove up to the motel  
In his town and country car  
He watched the working women  
With the field hands from the farm  
He walked into the lobby  
With his pleased to see you smile  
Scribbled on to the register  
His fictitious name and smiled  
The footsteps of a young girl  
Came tapping along the hall  
The outline of his features  
Were shadowed on the wall  
She stood a little nervous  
Half lit by the neon light  
That flashed in many colours  
Through the darkness of the night  
  
The skin on his face  
Like a well worn saddle  
Smiled as he said goodnight  
At the melody motel  
It was business as usual  
As the girls wiped the tears from their eyes  
  
His shirt lay by his bedside  
His jeans down by his feet  
She swallowed hard and mumbled  
With the key between her teeth  
On went the television  
The picture flickering slow  
Top cat in the alley way  
As they sat there all alone  
  
He drove back up his driveway  
In his town and country car  
His wife was cooking chicken  
With a baby in her arms  
The smell of home cooked dinner  
Filled the air at home that night  
Screaming Officer Dibble  
In the TV's flickering light  
  
Slumped in his favourite armchair  
His face as grey as stone  
His feet up on the table  
Next to the chicken bones  
He seemed to show no feelings  
Picking corn out from his teeth  
Police down at the motel  
As the blood dried on the sheets

"
538,Squeeze,Night Nurse,"Tell her try her best just to make it quick  
Woman tend to the sick  
Because there must be something she can do  
This heart is broken in two  
Tell her it's a case of emergency  
There's a patient by the name of Mickey  
  
Night nurse  
Only you alone can quench this here thirst  
My night nurse oh god  
Oh the pain is getting worse  
  
I don't want to see no doc  
I need attendance from my nurse around the clock  
Because there's no prescription for me  
She's the one the only remedy

My night nurse

Oh the pain is getting worse  
I'm hurt my love  
And I'm sure no no doctor got a cure  
  
My night nurse  
My night nurse  
My night nurse

"
539,Squeeze,Out Of Control,"I like schoolgirls and lollipops  
White socks and lemon drops  
Stack heels and knotted ties  
Tight jeans and painted eyes  
Girls dressed in hockey gear  
School days are always here  
Yeah, I'm out of control  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind saying  
It's gonna be a good one tonight  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind waiting  
For what you call a bit of alright  
I'm out of control  
I like big girls and Spiderman  
Deep water and Paris tan  
Short skirts and lace-up flies  
Long grass and starry nights  
All girls in navy blue  
Here's what we think of you  
Yeah, we're out of control  
We're out of control  
And I don't mind saying  
It's gonna be a good one tonight  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind waiting  
For what you call a bit of alright  
I'm out of control  
I like blonde hair and sailor's tops  
Fish tights and prison crops  
Long tongues and docker's grips  
Pony tails and sinking ships  
Swim suits and judo gear  
Look out the boys are here  
Singing we're out of control  
We're out of control  
And I don't mind saying  
It's gonna be a good one tonight  
I'm out of control  
And I don't mind waiting  
For what you call a bit of alright  
I'm out of control

"
540,Squeeze,Play On,"He wants to be glorified  
And swallowed in fame  
He wants to be a hero  
Like Kurt Cobain  
Playing his guitar  
With it hung round his knees  
The tour bus syndrome  
The touring disease  
He stands like a soldier  
He's ready to charge  
The young girls he sleeps with  
Are all a mirage  
He wants to be wanted  
But doesn't know why  
Reality curtains  
Black out a blue sky  
Play on play on and eat up the sun  
Pop up to London and soak up the fun  
Play on play on with gathering speed  
Its Saturday night  
As the ears start to bleed  
He wants to be famous a  
And fall when he's young  
Climbing up ladders  
Without any rungs  
Ill in the morning  
And wasted all day  
Looking demented  
With not much to say  
He pulls out a woman  
From under his bed  
Her eyes are like cherries  
That spin in her head  
If he hits the jackpot  
He's in the top ten

"
541,Squeeze,Points Of View,"I'm impossible she's exciting  
Bound together with joined up writing  
In the church  
I heard a bell ring  
In a bar  
I heard a girl sing  
She sings solo I see double  
Moments vanish her love so subtle  
I went home  
It's not surprising  
Words were few  
And realizing  
I was deep in my points of view  
So interested to talk to you talk to you  
She' s romantic and I'm selected  
Glances swapped and thoughts collected  
By her song  
It's not her singing  
Words were few  
The bell was ringing  
On the table my cards are shuffled  
Words take time to get so muddled  
I'm off home  
I'm shy but eager  
Tomorrow comes  
I hope to see her  
On the stage with her velvet voice  
Though some would say that it's just a noise  
I bit off more than I could chew  
So interested in my points of view points of view  
  
Trial and jury swear on the bible  
I'm too drunk and unreliable  
I'm too drunk  
For conversation  
Though I wait for invitation  
She's exciting I'm uninvited  
Fifteen rounds this love I've fighted  
I'll walk home  
And curse the heavens  
Lost on points  
Our love was flattened  
Maybe she had other things to do  
And didn't want any points of view

"
542,Squeeze,Pulling Mussels,"They do it down on Camber Sands, they do it at Waikiki  
Lazing about this beach all day night, the crickets creepy  
Squinting faces at the sky, a Harold Robbins paperback  
Surfers drop their boards and dry and everybody wants a hat  
But behind the chalet, my holiday?s complete  
And I feel like William Tell, Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Shrinking in the sea so cold, topless ladies look away  
A He-man in a sudden shower shelters from the rain  
You wish you had a motor boat to pose around the harbor bar  
When the sun goes off to bed, you hook it up behind the car  
But behind the chalet, my holiday?s complete  
And I feel like William Tell, Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Two fat ladies window shop something for the mantelpiece  
In for bingo all the nines, a panda for sweet little niece  
The coach drivers stand about looking at a local map  
About the boy, he's gone away, down to next door?s caravan  
But behind the chalet, my holiday?s complete  
And I feel like William Tell, Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
But behind the chalet, my holiday?s complete  
And I feel like William Tell, Maid Marian on her tiptoed feet  
Pulling mussels from the shell  
Pulling mussels from the shell  

"
543,Squeeze,Satisfied,"They had just made love  
Silent on the bed  
This was their celebration  
She had her eyes closed  
Nothing was said  
They had fulfilled temptation  
He looked through the curtains  
He looked at the phone  
He couldn't be certain if this was his home  
Satisfied that this was it  
A rhythmic breath and a gentle grip  
Satisfied and they were sure  
They couldn't fulfill each other more  
  
They stroked each other  
He played with her hair  
Deep in a warm sedation  
The legs of his jeans  
Hung over the chair  
Love was their meditation  
She looked at his shoulders  
She looked at his eyes  
The look there told her he was satisfied  
  
They laid there apart  
In another world  
Deep in a warm sedation  
As love turned to sleep  
Their bodies curled  
Into sweet inspiration  
They looked at each other  
They looked at the night  
Under the covers they were satisfied

"
544,Squeeze,Separate Beds,"Tonight I take her from her parents  
I came along to her rescue  
Without a word about arrangements  
She came along without a clue  
So I said my love I want to take you  
A place I have inside my head  
And so it seemed I had to love you  
With some cards and separate beds  
  
Her mother didn't like me  
She thought I was on drugs  
My mother didn't like her  
She'd never peel the spuds  
So we took off together  
And stayed at Mrs. Smith's  
Breakfast at half seven  
Where you can view the cliffs  
  
The moon was full and in our window  
I could see her turning in her bed  
I was loved but all in limbo  
There was time to pass but not to spend  
Soon I saw that this was silly  
Spending all my wages on this peach  
When we could sit so very pretty  
And get our heads down out on the beach  
  
Her father seemed to like me  
I helped him fix his car  
My father seemed to like her  
And I couldn't see the harm  
In going off together  
To see the pier and lights  
So we could be together  
In separate beds tonight

"
545,Squeeze,She Doesn't Have To Shave,"She was washing the dishes  
When she burst into tears  
It was the time of the month  
She was up to her ears  
I put my arms round her neck  
I said sit down a while  
Cry as much as you like  
I'll do the dishes  
Tell me what's on your mind  
There's a boiling point  
That you're bound to reach  
When it's all your fault  
And you're half asleep.  
She's lucky she doesn't have to shave  
I'm so lucky I'm not doubled up with pain  
  
Her eyes were like pools  
Filled with newly wed tears  
She was sat doubled up  
With her hands on her ears  
I felt useless  
I smiled and I shrugged  
I was sweet as could be  
As I poured her some milk  
Here was my flower  
That was ready to wilt  
  
A fairy tale finish  
We flaked out on the floor  
It was match of the day  
On the TV what's more  
I fell asleep at half time  
We had had a right result  
It was kisses and hugs  
At the end of the day  
She's the one that I love

"
546,Squeeze,Short Break,"(DiffordTilbrook)  
He raped her with his eyes the minute she walked into the office as she
stretched to hang her coat behind the door he beamed a smile so big she could
have filled it with helium and flown off across the countryside he tried very
hard to invite her out for lunch but like most women she could sense the
underlying note of danger her instincts kept him at a safe distance and then
he made her a coffee and the steam rose across her face  
It could be you it could be me  
We'll have to wait we'll have to see  
Its all for sale now that its time  
To take a short break  
  
The sensation of safety and the little boy ambition to drive around  
Mountain roads makes a woman mad for attention she hides the car keys he turns
the place upside down and then looks out the window through the french blinds
to see the car off in the distance a cloud of country dust feathers the
sunlight as she smiles into the windscreen what can he do but wait patiently
folding a coin through his fingers  
  
It could be you it could be me  
We'll have to wait we'll have to see  
It's all for sale now that it's time  
To take a short break  
  
There she is again this time with a pair of jeans being pulled slowly up over
the curves of her body he plays guitar in the rocking chair these are the
jeans of our forefathers these are the jeans of the 21st century because this
is the new world where television and eye become one as we look down the
digital telescope into the future and now its time for a short break  
It could be you it could be me  
We'll have to wait we'll have to see  
Its all for sale now that its time  
Its lighter than air  
Whiter than white draft in a can  
The price is right save as you go  
The drive of your life its good to talk

547,Squeeze,Slap And Tickle,"She was frigid like a Bible  
When she met her boyfriend Michael  
He took her in his Zephyr  
They sat like salt and pepper  
Looking out across the city  
From Lover's Leap is pretty  
The lights they flick and flutter  
He told her how he loved her  
Next night he called for her  
But Dad protected daughter  
And told him she was poorly  
A lie was told there surely  
So Michael felt rejected  
This wasn't quite expected  
He drove off to his local  
Where he felt anti-social  
  
She cried all night at missing  
The boy she could be kissing  
While he was falling over  
He drunk himself back sober  
And went home in a taxi  
And crashed out in the back seat  
He slept just like a baby  
Which he hadn't done just lately  
He saw her in the morning  
Out with his sister Pauline  
She felt all shy and soppy  
He acted cool and cocky  
He said tonight at Charlie's  
There's going to be a party  
I'll meet you at half seven  
She visualized the heaven  
  
If you ever change your mind  
Which you do from time to time  
Never chew a pickle  
With a little slap and tickle  
You have to throw the stone  
To get the pool to ripple  
  
That night they danced together  
It looked like love forever  
He put his hand on her leg  
You should have heard what she said  
He tried again much later  
It seemed to aggravate her  
He drove home in silence  
Avoiding all violence  
She said let's watch the city  
From Lover's Leap is pretty  
I think I need the fresh air  
She put a comb through her hair  
Then while she turned to kiss him  
And very nearly missed him  
She put her hand on his leg  
He felt her tongue in his head  
  
If you ever change your mind  
Which you do from time to time  
Never chew a pickle  
With a little slap and tickle  
You have to throw the stone  
To get the pool to ripple

"
548,Squeeze,Someone Else's Bell,"We talk about each other  
On our wrap around couch,  
And live out all the romance  
In our little town house.  
I never fit the shower  
And she never sews the threads,  
And so we find our feelings  
In other people's beds.  
And if the grass seems greener,  
But it turns out to be blue  
The garden of Eden isn't quite the place for you.  
Don't be surprised if I'm gone under the spell,  
Of some other witches' wand  
Ringing someone else's bell.  
  
Meeting on the motorway  
Your lover boy blue,  
Steaming up the windows  
With your last breath of youth.  
Don't you think I see it  
Your handbag's full of notes,  
I'm feeling like the punch line  
In someone's private joke.  
  
Our eyes don't seem to contact  
Never much to say,  
Except perhaps excuse me  
Or pass me the ashtray.  
I see him waiting for you  
As you go off to work,  
I'm left to draw conclusions  
While I button up my shirt.

"
549,Squeeze,Someone Else's Heart,"I got nosy and I read her letters  
I read her diary it's the same story and nothing better,  
The words remind me of someone else's heart  
Has gone and left a mark.  
And the pop music plays  
On the local radio,  
There's people on the streets but no one that I know  
And like my heart is now  
I know not where they go.  
  
Same words different meaning  
Same heart different feeling,  
So much for him so much for her 'cause that's past,  
Now I know about that someone else's heart.  
  
She got nosy and read my letters too  
And my notebook surprised to find that  
Love is not so new,  
So we both took  
Someone else's heart  
And walked it through the dark.  
  
A feeling so rich  
I turned around to laugh,  
We had both indulged in each other's past  
To find out that our love  
Was true enough to last.

"
550,Squeeze,Sound Asleep,"Tonight there's wind  
Tonight there's rain  
Tonight I sleep with myself again  
I punch the pillow into a mound  
With this frustration that I have found  
Today I hoped  
Today I heard  
There's still no contact  
Still no word  
I want to hear the front door slam  
I want you back to hold my hand  
Tonight there's hope you'll comfort me  
All I can do is wait and see  
But my eyes begin to close  
As footsteps softly creep  
To find me sound asleep  
  
Tonight there's pain  
Tonight there's fear  
Tonight it's cold now you're not here  
The sound of tyres out in the wet  
That's as close to you as I can get  
No turning handle on our front door  
The more I hate you I want you more

"
551,Squeeze,Spanish Guitar,"Talking to demons that fly through the room  
When I'm home late and she's gone out of tune  
No more excuses, I'm being locked out  
The key to her heart will never be found  
I can't get close to the one that I love  
I try to reason but that's not enough  
It was all right then, love was there in a friend  
Cold nights on sofas, the birds sing all night  
Their song my story which sums up my life  
The life I'm losing, the love I'll regret  
No sheets, no pillows to make up by bed  
Upon the toilet I think very hard  
Love's in the tune of my Spanish guitar  
And we're together now, harmony's been found  
And the Spanish guitar can play  
Strum, strum, strumming away  
She's the guitar that went out of tune  
But now she's in love with you  
In love with you, in love with you

552,Squeeze,Stranger Than The Stranger On The Shore,"Acid casualties and angry young men  
The litmus test of a guitar and pen  
Revolve around date sheets lost lonely rooms  
And this is my home and I will leave soon  
For a house with a tower  
Where there's visiting hours  
And the day leaves its taste on a spoon  
The black eye of the camera bruised by my blush  
Leaves another chin and another hair cut  
The image in focus the shot aims to kill  
And I'm cropped at the waist as I run through the mill  
So I'm lost for an encore  
The Kodachrome wants more  
Now I'm snapped with my head in the still  
  
The contract's been signed with a stroke of my blood  
I'm drowned by the name that sinks in the mud  
Thrown from emotion to swim back to the shore  
Where the sound of a drum beats time to applause  
Now my life's in danger  
Of ending up stranger  
Than the stranger who walked on the shore  
  
Stranger than the stranger  
Who walks by my bed  
Shares in my life  
Lives although dead  
Stranger than the stranger I am sure  
Stranger than the stranger on the shore

553,Squeeze,Striking Matches,"Striking matches and I'm smoking cigarettes  
Putting on the kettle, playing a cassette  
Folding up the papers rubbing my eyes  
Thinking of all that had happened last night  
The passion, the feelings that soaked in her love  
And the pools of silence when kisses were sprung  
Her love levitates me, I'm walking on air  
Two feet from the carpet, I'll always be there  
Oh I'm striking matches it's morning again  
I look in the mirror i still look the same  
I'm striking matches it's morning again  
I look in the mirror i go up in flames  
  
Striking matches getting a flame on the stove  
There's some of her in the teeth of my comb  
Dirty clothes piled up on the bathroom floor  
She's silently sleeping, i half close the door  
I see her beauty laying on my bed  
I'm warm from within me with what she has said  
Her love is my balloon, i won't let it down  
For ever and ever I'll always be proud.  
  
I'm a director casting for a part  
(turn on the light)  
It's for a soap set here right in my heart.  
(leave her alone)  
Shuffle to the window shuffle to the door  
(don't wake her up)  
She gets the part i don't want to see anymore  
(unplug the phone)

554,Squeeze,Strong In Reason,"You get your trunks  
Out of the drawer  
You see yourself  
As once before  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
The empty box  
Lies on the chair  
Another steroid  
Grease your hair and you're  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason

Is put away  
There is no need  
To be afraid

Your audience  
Is half awake and you're

To flex your back  
Another day  
For you, meat-rack

Strong with almost perfect charm  
Strong intention  
Strong in strength  
Strong in almost every sense  
  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
  
And on the stage  
The lights are green  
It's one step forward  
Now you've been seen  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
  
The right arm up  
The left arm down  
Open mouth  
The vacant crowd  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
  
The chest of wax  
Flips like a coin  
Into the rhythm  
Into the join  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason

The comfortable seats  
They look at you with  
Eyes so deep 'cause they're

Well take a bow  
Because you'll get th

555,Squeeze,Sunday Street,"I'm down the lane on Sunday morning  
Hung over and forever yawning  
I look for trousers that will fit me  
She buys a yellow shirt that's sickly  
A sarsparilla drink turns white teeth shades of pink  
Sunday league play in the sunshine  
I hear the whistle blow at halftime  
With chapped legs and muddy shorts  
They walk home past the tennis courts  
A pint of prawns in hand  
I hear a ragtime band  
  
On Monday  
I want the weekend to come  
On Tuesday  
I'm glad that Monday is done  
Then Wednesday  
And Thursday fly by  
Then on Friday and Saturday night  
We get happy till Sunday is through  
  
Siesta time in the living room  
Snores go in and out of tune  
After tea time we're off to the pub  
To play in the trivia club  
How long's the river Thames?  
It's where the evening ends  
In my bed I'm reading poetry  
No one knows what's come over me  
I close the book and turning out the light  
I hear the sound of Monday outside

"
556,Squeeze,Take Me I'm Yours,"I've come across the desert  
To greet you with a smile  
My camel looks so tired  
It's hardly worth my while  
To tell you of my travels  
Across the golden east  
I see your preparations  
Invite me first to the feast  
Take me I'm yours  
Because dreams are made of this  
Forever there'll be  
A heaven in your kiss  
  
Amusing belly dancers  
Distract me from my wine  
Across Tibetan mountains  
Are memories of mine  
I've stood some ghostly moments  
With natives in the hills  
Recorded here on paper  
My chills and thrills and spills  
Take me I'm yours  
Because dreams are made of this  
Forever there'll be  
A heaven in your kiss  
  
It's really been some welcome  
You never seem to change  
A grape to tempt your leisure  
Romantic gestures strange  
My eagle flies tomorrow  
It's a game I treasure dear  
To seek the helpless future  
My love at last I'm here  
Take me I'm yours  
Because dreams are made of this  
Forever there'll be  
A heaven in your kiss

557,Squeeze,Talk To Him,"Give me a plate and I'd break it  
Show me a smile and I'd cry  
Give me your love and I'd hate it  
Tell me the truth and I'd lie  
Give me a crust and I'd burn it  
Show me the way and I'd shout  
Give me a page and I'd turn it  
Well you could never put me down  
  
Misunderstood like a cockroach  
(As tasty as a crab)  
Who just tries to live for the day  
(My world's on my back)  
People won't need to be frightened  
(As frightened as I am)  
Excepting I was born this way  
  
Don't sweep me under the carpet  
(Tomorrow I'll be there)  
Don't file me away for my sins  
(There's some I can repair)  
Friends are now beginning to say  
(So pleased with their despair)  
How come I don't talk to him  
I didn't talk to him  
  
Give me an egg and I'd suck it  
Show me the sun and I'd freeze  
Give me a nest and some honey  
Keep all the birds and the bees, please  
Helplessness under my wing  
People said don't talk to him

558,Squeeze,Temptation For Love,"What have I done  
What did I say  
Am I the one  
You can not face  
When I need love  
I look to you  
But when I search I can not trace  
A beat of your heart, a shadow or shape  
Could it be me that learns to mistake temptation  
Temptation for love  
  
Why don't we try  
To talk it through  
And we may find  
Some common ground  
I realize  
That once again  
I search for what can not be found  
A beat of your heart, a shadow or shape  
Could it be me that learns to mistake temptation  
Temptation for love  
  
Is there a bond that we haven't found  
Now that you're gone I lie awake  
Now I've mistaken  
  
Words fail me now  
I fear the worst  
I let you down  
And can not face  
What I have done  
To you this time  
I called on you but couldn't trace  
A beat of your heart, a shadow or shape  
Could it be me that learns to mistake temptation  
Temptation for love

559,Squeeze,The Apple Tree,"Power station by the river  
Grinding slowly to a stop  
Clock still ticking on the mantle  
Flames still flicker on the log  
Coffee brewing in the kitchen  
Where the door is open wide  
Glass upon a hovered carpet  
Eyes are glowing in the night  
  
It's the silence you can see  
Hearing shadows behind me  
  
All the buildings standing empty  
All the trains are standing still  
Cars are scattered by the roadside  
There's no top upon the hill  
Nails have scratched upon the outside  
Of the empty chapel door  
But i don't think that the father  
  
Wants to live there anymore  
There's no bone for you to pick  
No more wax around the wick  
  
Shot the arrow from the circle  
At the apple on the tree  
From a garden that was eden  
Strange the fruit it bears for me  
And the wind will spread the fire  
And the rain will ever fall  
If no one reads the writing  
That's been written on the wall  
  
Underneath the apple tree  
There's a ghost who waits for me  
  
The apple tree shakes its arms  
Its fruit falls  
Its fruits are tasting strange  
The apple tree is shaking

560,Squeeze,The Day I Get Home,"When this young man comes rolling home  
The lamp posts move and in the road  
I sing and dance in falling rain  
It's good to be back home again  
The roads of air that map the globe  
Take me away to places new  
I'm lucky I can get around  
I'm taking off and touching down  
When I get home it's much the same  
The tax returns return again  
The news is on it isn't good  
I see the trees but not the wood  
  
The road stretches out as far as I can see  
And I eat the lines ahead of me  
It's experience  
As the days unfold  
But there's nothing quite like  
The day I get home  
  
When this young man comes rolling home  
The cheese on toast is in the grill  
Memories are filed away  
I come and go, it's fun that way  
The roads of air that map the globe  
Go east and west and north and south  
I like to look and see the sights  
I stay up late and hit the heights  
  
When I return things haven't changed  
Neither have I, I like to think  
The world's an oyster on a plate  
I get around and get up late

"
561,Squeeze,The Elephant Ride,"Today is none of our concern  
That rewarding cigarette  
That burns slowly by the bed  
Fills the room with mystery  
The apple ripens on the tree  
That protected seal of love  
Broken by the flame of fun  
Lying back with Exodus  
In the arms of lovers trust  
  
That romantic dance of light  
From the curtain broken night  
Shadows fall on mystery  
Love has ripened here for me  
Stubbing out the cigarette  
I see the clothes beside the bed  
As the half light of the day  
Pulls the sheet up once again  
  
As the phone hangs by the cord  
As the streets begin to fill  
There's no distance anymore  
There's no wanting when you will  
Will be sleeping through the day  
As the world around us turns  
As the phone hangs by the cord  
Today is none of our concern

"
562,Squeeze,The Truth,"I lied to you, I've cheated too  
So what friend can I be  
But still you stick through thick and thin  
Hoping that you'll change me  
I towed the line then fell behind  
Our love began to wane  
The pressure grew and then I knew  
That things were not the same  
The truth  
It's the toughest thing to explain  
The truth  
Playing tricks with me again  
When the truth has to be told  
My blood runs hot and cold  
The truth is not my middle name  
  
You threw a rope attached with hope  
Way down into the sea  
Where lovers swim so deep within  
The tides of mystery  
For what it's worth I don't deserve  
A girl as strong as you  
You're worth much more than me I'm sure  
Accept this as the truth

"
563,Squeeze,The Waiting Game,"I heard the stomping of feet dancing  
On the wooden floor upstairs  
I wasn't in the mood for laughing  
So I sat silent in my chair  
There was someone missing I knew  
Outside there fell the rain  
Where had she gone, what could I do  
I played the waiting game  
The cigarette smoke was annoying  
My mood was fit for a bath  
A drink couldn't oil my expression  
Nothing could've made me laugh  
I was worried out of my head  
I was in such a state  
What's keeping her, where has she gone  
I played the waiting game  
When you love someone  
You worry when they're late  
When you trust someone  
You know the time it takes  
To play the waiting game  
The music got louder and louder  
From the wooden floor upstairs  
I played with a handful of peanuts  
Then I saw her standing there  
My mood leapt right out of the bath  
She had got stuck in the rain  
Her coat dripped on a hanger  
Playing the waiting  
I couldn't understand her  
Playing the waiting  
Seemed like I'd wait forever  
Playing the waiting game

"
564,Squeeze,There Is A Voice,"There is a voice within us all  
That says destruct  
Go to the wall  
And you can't choose when this voice speaks  
Deep in our souls  
This voice will sleep  
There is a voice within us all  
That says destruct  
And you will crawl  
From your own pit into the deep  
Where you will sink  
Until it speaks  
  
Each day is a night  
Then your lifetime is gone  
  
There is a voice inside us all  
That says rebuild  
  
And when it's called  
All that is wrong can be put right  
There in your soul  
To change your life  
Each day's a hope each day's a prayer  
That I might build  
And I'll repair  
The parts in me that may have slipped  
Deep in my soul  
When I lose my grip  
  
And there's ropes and chains  
Slowing me as I walk  
I feel hope through pain  
As the road ahead forks  
To the left and the right  
To the right and the wrong

"
565,Squeeze,There's No Tomorrow,"There's no tomorrow  
When you feel sorrow,  
There's just the evening  
There's just the night,  
To drink the feelings  
Right out the ceiling  
There's no tomorrow, now there's tonight.  
There's no remembers  
There's no pretenders,  
There's just the weakness  
There's just the thought,  
So drink those troubles  
Through several doubles  
There's no tomorrow, 'cause life's too short.  
  
There's no expression  
There's no aggression,  
There's just the sadness  
There's just the pain  
So drink to mysteries,  
With one more whiskey  
There's no expression, I'm drunk again.  
  
There's no tomorrow  
When you feel hollow,  
There's just the barman  
To lend an ear  
So drink to lovers,  
If there are others  
There's no tomorrow, tomorrow's here.

"
566,Squeeze,This Summer,"Brain engages mouth  
Mouth expresses thoughts  
Of how we shared those fun fair rides  
Beneath the brightness of the night  
Time can crowd the head  
Like a sardine can  
The summer that began to blur  
Has put us on the calendar  
  
This summer there won't be a cloud in the sky  
I'm so made up I feel I could take off and fly  
This summer we've pulled all the sheets off the bed  
I'm so happy I can't get you out of my head  
This summer I am so in love with you  
  
Mornings pass us by  
As curtains hide the sun  
Nights we spent out of control  
Like two flags wrapped around a pole  
  
I see the helter skelter lights  
And hear the music in the breeze  
And when we're skimming stones tonight  
It feels so good that you're with me  
  
This summer there won't be a cloud in the sky  
I'm so made up I feel I could take off and fly  
This summer we've pulled all the sheets off the bed  
I'm so happy I can't get you out of my head  
There's no reason to ever feel lonely again  
This summer I am so in love with you

"
567,Squeeze,Tongue Like A Knife,"The head of a hunt on the wall by a painting  
An upright piano stood locked by the door  
In through the window  
The light was fast fading  
While I split my whiskey  
All over the floor  
Making a mess of my words so  
I was trying  
To impress the Empress with  
My wimpy tales  
Fanning her face from cigar smoke  
And sighing  
I had come close to be miles  
From her trail  
  
She was the jewel that  
Sparkled in darkness  
She was the love  
Of everyone's life  
She was the catch at  
Everyone's parties  
She was the one with a tongue  
Like a knife  
  
Her bosoms curved perfectly  
Lit by the fire  
My mind launched away  
In a sea of its own  
Her grace and her tightness  
I had to admire  
Through a whore's breath of stories  
I happily told  
  
Trespassing my hand  
Fell into hot water  
She shot like a bullet  
Right out of her chair  
She led me away and I  
Was then slaughtered  
By the warmth of her body  
And her love and care  
  
Her tongue cut away  
And the wounds slowly opened  
I lay on the sails of the  
Ship of romance  
Drunk as I could be and  
Broker than broken and  
The head of my hunt  
Was there in my hands

"
568,Squeeze,Trust,"Trust in me my tongue is weeping  
Words of love you must be needing  
Trust me for the only reason  
That our love will never weaken  
  
Trust in me as someone you love  
Trust in me a little closer  
Trust the soul of every soldier  
Trust in me each beat taps lightly  
  
On your door so now invite me  
Trust in me as someone you love  
  
Someone that you love  
Someone that you trust  
Someone to love you more and more  
  
Trust in me the words are woven  
Words of love can not be broken  
Trust before a night together  
The secret's ours in trust forever  
Trust in me as someone you love

"
569,Squeeze,Trust Me To Open My Mouth,"Trust me to open my mouth, now everybody knows  
Trust me, now I've let you down, I'm a big mouth I suppose.  
This was our secret, our meetings were so discreet  
I promised to keep it from the ears out on the street  
This was our secret, we were having an affair  
I couldn't keep it, now the secret's everywhere  
  
One cup runneth over, loosening a jaw  
Trust me to open my mouth, it's not a secret anymore  
We had a secret, what a terrible thing to do  
I couldn't have seen it, I was so in love so in love with you  
  
I need a gobstopper to keep my trap shut  
Got to keep my nose clean  
Why's it me that gets the bad luck?

"
570,Squeeze,Up The Junction,"I never thought it would happen  
With me and the girl from Clapham  
Out on the windy common  
That night I ain't forgotten  
When she dealt out the rations  
With some or other passions  
I said ""you are a lady""  
""Perhaps"" she said. ""I may be""  
  
We moved in to a basement  
With thoughts of our engagement  
We stayed in by the telly  
Although the room was smelly  
We spent our time just kissing  
The Railway Arms we're missing  
But love had got us hooked up  
And all our time it took up  
  
I got a job with Stanley  
He said I'd come in handy  
And started me on Monday  
So I had a bath on Sunday  
I worked eleven hours  
And bought the girl some flowers  
She said she'd seen a doctor  
And nothing now could stop her  
  
I worked all through the winter  
The weather brass and bitter  
I put away a tenner  
Each week to make her better  
And when the time was ready  
We had to sell the telly  
Late evenings by the fire  
With little kicks inside her  
  
This morning at four fifty  
I took her rather nifty  
Down to an incubator  
Where thirty minutes later  
She gave birth to a daughter  
Within a year a walker  
She looked just like her mother  
If there could be another  
  
And now she's two years older  
Her mother's with a soldier  
She left me when my drinking  
Became a proper stinging  
The devil came and took me  
From bar to street to bookie  
No more nights by the telly  
No more nights nappies smelling  
  
Alone here in the kitchen  
I feel there's something missing  
I'd beg for some forgiveness  
But begging's not my business  
And she won't write a letter  
Although I always tell her  
And so it's my assumption  
I'm really up the junction

"
571,Squeeze,Vicky Verky,"With her hair up in his fingers  
The fish and chips smell lingers  
Under amber streetlamps  
She holds the law in her hands  
The moistness of the damp night  
Falls silent through the lamplight  
Although she's only fourteen  
She really knows her courting  
And up the railway sidings  
There's him and her  
They're lying  
Hand in hand they whisper  
You're my missus and I'm your mister  
The moon as white and virgin  
And she was on the turning  
Remember your first nibble  
When best friends were so little  
  
They really trooped the colors  
When walking with each other  
And all her mates would giggle  
As ladylike she'd wiggle  
All along the high street  
They'd splash out on an ice cream  
He'd sometimes really treat her  
But he'd done his mother's meter  
  
Well he went off to borstal  
He said that he was forced to  
Rob the flats of hi fi's  
'cause she was ill  
And she would cry  
Each morning she got sicker  
Her mother sometimes hit her  
If she'd have known the story  
She would have been so sorry  
  
He received a letter and admitted it  
There was nothing else to do but get rid of it  
Lonely in his dormitory  
He'd sit and stare  
If this is for real  
And is it really fair  
  
Summer came so they went  
Down to the coast in his tent  
She cooked upon his primus  
And sampled local cider  
She told him in his rucksack  
I think i want that chance back  
To be perhaps the one who  
Will forever love you

572,Squeeze,What's Wrong With This Picture?,"What's wrong with this picture  
Her eyes are like moons  
It's just like looking

What does it reveal  
Beauty speaks  
There's so much to say  
Tell me what's wrong with this picture today  
  
What's wrong with this picture  
She's lighter than air  
Life seems to be happening  
But she is not there  
The late night temptation  
The eyes on her skin  
What's wrong with this picture  
There's nobody in  
  
What's wrong with this picture  
Location withdrawn  
It's empty without you  
Your face so forlorn  
  
Shake yourself  
Sweep you head away

573,U2,11 O'clock Tick Tock,"It's cold outside  
It gets so hot in here  
And the boys and girls collide  
To the music in my ear  
  
Hear the children crying  
And I know it's time to go  
I hear the children crying  
Take me home  
  
A painted face  
And I know we haven't long  
We thought that we had the answers  
It was the questions we had wrong  
  
Hear the children crying  
And I know it's time to go  
I hear the children crying  
Take me home

I can see through you  
From where you're sitting, pretty one  
I know it got to you  
  
I see the stars in your eyes  
You want the truth, but you need the lies  
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino  
You give your life for rock n' roll  
Uh huh  
  
Stand, we're on a landslide of love  
You got everything you want  
But what you need you give away  
  
For primitive love  
And a ride on the mystery train  
A primitive love  
A room at the Heart...

You let them suck your life out like honey  
Turning tricks, you're on the street  
Selling your kisses so bittersweet

A primitive love  
A and a ride on the mystery train

Well if you dream then dream out loud, always  
Eternally yours, always

I want you  
I want you  
  
Touching the other side  
I wanted to be in love  
I wanted to call

Don't find yourself in someone else, always  
And always wear a safety belt, always  
Wait for me I'm running late, always

Turn each song into a prayer, always

Traveling sales people on my mother's side

Every day I have to find the courage  
To walk out into the street  
With arms out  
Got a love you can't defeat  
Neither down nor out  
There's nothing you have that I need  
I can breathe  
Breathe now

But I'm running down the road like loose electricity  
While the band in my head plays a striptease  
  
The roar that lies on the other side of silence  
The forest fire that is fear so deny it  
  
Walk out into the street  
Sing your heart out  
The people we meet  
Will not be drowned out

I found grace, it's all that I found  
And I can breathe

And I can see those fighter planes  
And I can see those fighter planes

Through the alleys of a quiet city street  
You take the staircase to the first floor  
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door  
As a man breathes into a saxophone  
And through the walls you hear the city groan  
Outside is America  
Outside is America, America  
  
Across the field you see the sky ripped open  
See the rain through a gaping wound  
Pounding on the women and children  
Who run  
Into the arms

Nothing's simple as you think  
  
Wake up  
Some things you can't get around  
I'm in you  
More so when they put me in the ground  
  
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill  
These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill...

You know these hands never worked a day  
Take these boots they're going nowhere  
You know these boots don't want to stray  
  
You got my head filled with songs  
You got my shoelaces undone  
Take my shirt, go on take it off me  
You can tear it up  
If you can tie me down  
  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
  
Take the colors of my imagination  
Take the scent hanging in the air  
Take this tangle of a conversation  
And turn it into your own prayer  
  
With my fingers as you want them  
With my nails under your hide  
With my teeth at your back  
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies  
  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
And it looks like the sun  
But it feels like the rain  
  
Love's a bully pushing and shoving  
In the belly of a woman  
Heavy rhythm taking over  
To stick together  
A man and a woman  
Stick together  
Man and woman  
Stick together...  
  
And I feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
And it looks like the sun

To see us through the rain

You hurt yourself you hurt your lover  
Then you discover  
What you thought was freedom is just greed

No one here to blame  
No one to point the finger

It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Would everything be alright  
God has got his phone off the hook, babe  
Would he even pick up if he could  
It's been a while since we saw that child  
Hanging 'round this neighborhood  
You see his mother dealing in a doorway  
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl  
Jesus sister's eyes are a blister  
The High Street never looked so low  
It's the blind, leading the blond  
It's the cops collecting for the cons  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Where do we go  
Where do we go  
Jesus never let me down  
You know Jesus used to show me the score  
Then they put Jesus in show business  
Now it's hard to get in the door  
It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs  
But I guess it was something to go on  
So where is the hope and where is the faith  
And the love...what's that you say to me  
Does love...light up your Christmas Tree  
The next minute your blowing a fuse  
And the cartoon network turns into the news  
If God will send his angels  
I sure could use them here right now  
Well if God would send his angels  
Where do we go  
I don't need to lie  
I don't need to know  
And I don't want to promise  
And I don't want to lie  
I just want to feel the song

Into a glass of water  
I've been good 'cause I know you don't want me to  
Do you really want me to be as blue as you  
It's her daylight that gets me through  
  
We've been here before  
Last time you scratched at my door  
The moon was naked and cold  
I was like a two year old  
Who just wanted more  
If you wear that velvet dress  
If you wear that velvet dress  
  
Tonight the moon has drawn its curtains  
It's a private show no one else going to know  
I'm waiting  
  
Sunlight  
Sunlight fills my room  
It's sharp and it's clear  
But nothing at all like the moon  
  
It's okay  
The struggle for things not to say  
I never listened to you anyway  
And I got my own hands to pray  
  
If you wear that velvet dress  
If you wear that velvet dress  
  
Tonight the moon is a mirror ball  
Light flickers from across the hall  
Who'll catch the star when it falls  
  
If you wear that velvet dress  
If you wear that velvet dress

Knows I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight  
  
There's a part of me in chaos that's quiet  
And there's a part of you that wants me to riot  
Everybody needs to cry or needs to spit  
Every sweet-tooth needs just a little hit  
Every beauty needs to go out with an idiot  
How can you stand next to the truth and not see it?  
Change of heart comes slow  
  
It's not a hill it's a mountain  
As you start out the climb  
Do you believe me or are you doubting?  
We're gonna make it all the way to the light  
But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight  
  
Every generation gets a chance to change the world  
Pity the nation that won't listen to your boys and girls  
Is the sweetest melody the one we haven't heard?  
Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear?  
The right to be ridiculous is something I hold dear  
But change of heart comes slow  
  
It's not a hill it's a mountain  
As you start out the climb  
You see for me I've been shouting  
But we're gonna make it all the way to the light  
But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight  
  
Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone  
Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
It's not a hill it's a mountain  
You see for me I've been shouting

You know we'll go crazy  
You know we'll go crazy  
You know we'll go crazy, if we don't go crazy tonight

Everything is all right, everything is all right

A tourist in a traffic jam, baby sham and handy cam  
I'm not your mother, you're not my man, I'm not your baby

Don't need no doctor, I'm not ill, I'm not your baby  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
Cut out the poetry, lets hit the main artery  
No time for a tourniquet, the colors all run out of me  
You brought me all kinds of goods, now my heart is so full up it hurts  
It's heavy as a shopping bag, it's full of things I should give back  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
I'm not your baby  
I'm not your baby  
Don't want you to cover me, smother me or mother me  
I like to feel this incomplete, I'm not your baby  
Everything is all right, everything is all right  
I'm not your baby, please  
Not dizzy, just busy, didn't drink nothing fizzy  
No pills to feel easy, don't know what got into me  
Daylight's a kind of robbery, the night is your geography  
So you're not white, you're pink and rosy  
You could be right, but you're way above me  
Me, I'm in recovery, a star of pornography  
I'm a tourist, there's a lot to see  
You don't like the photographs of me  
So you've got a lot to say  
You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray  
You don't believe, often times you pray  
For something, what is it babe  
Don't treat me like I'm a trick, I won't treat you like you're a prick  
Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick, I'm not your baby  
Everything is all right, everything is all right

Oh, when I saw her  
In a pram they pushed her by  
  
My, how you've grown  
Well it's been  
It's been a little while  
  
Slow down my beating heart  
Man dreams one day to fly  
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies  
He lives on a star that's dying in the night  
And follows in the trail  
The scatter of light  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
You turn me on  
  
Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love  
Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love  
Slow down my beating heart  
Slowly, slowly love

Up for air to swim against the tide

So wind blow through my soul  
So wind blow through to my heart  
So wind blow through my soul  
So wind blow through to my heart...  
  
You give yourself to this the longest day  
You give yourself, you give it all away  
Two rivers run too deep  
The seasons change and so do I  
The light that strikes the tallest trees  
Will light a way for I  
Will light a way  
Up toward the sky  
It's a blue sky  
  
To lose along the way  
The spark that set the flame  
To flicker and to fade  
On this the longest day  
  
So wind go through to my heart  
So wind blow through my soul  
So wind go through to my heart

Slip slide  
The world turns and we get dizzy  
Slipping away

The past is too uncomfortable

And when you're dry  
She draws her water from the stone  
  
And I feel  
Like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under  
And I feel  
Like I'm holding onto nothing  
  
She wore lemon  
To color in the cold grey night  
She had heaven  
And she held on so tight  
  
A man makes a picture  
A moving picture  
Through the light projected  
He can see himself up close  
A man captures color  
A man likes to stare  
He turns his money into light to look for her  
  
And I feel  
Like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore  
And I feel  
Like I'm swimming out to her  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
  
Lemon  
See through in the sunlight  
  
A man builds a city  
With banks and cathedrals  
A man melts the sand so he can  
See the world outside  
Her there  
A man makes a car  
Destination  
And builds roads to run them on  
A man dreams of leaving  
But he always stays behind  
  
And these are the days  
When our work has come asunder  
And these are the days  
When we look for something other  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
  
A man makes a picture  
A moving picture  
Through the light projected  
He can see himself up close  
Her there  
A man captures color  
Destination  
A man likes to stare  
There  
He turns his money into light  
To look for her  
She is the dreamer  
She's imagination  
Through the light projected  
He can see himself up close

Come forth and speak to me  
Raise me up and don't let me fall  
No man is my enemy  
My own hands imprison me  
Love rescue me  
  
Many strangers have I met  
On the road to my regret  
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me  
They ask me to reveal  
The very thoughts they would conceal  
Love rescue me  
  
And the sun in the sky  
Makes a shadow of you and I  
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea  
I'm here without a name  
In the palace of my shame  
Said, love rescue me  
  
In the cold mirror of a glass  
I see my reflection pass  
See the dark shades of what I used to be  
See the purple of her eyes  
The scarlet of my lies  
Love rescue me  
  
Yea, though I walk  
In the valley of shadow  
Yea, I will fear no evil  
I have cursed thy rod and staff  
They no longer comfort me  
Love rescue me

I said love  
Climb up the mountains, said love  
I said love, oh my love  
On the hill of the son  
I'm on the eve of a storm  
And my word you must believe in  
Oh, I said love, rescue me  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...  
  
Yeah I'm here without a name  
In the palace of my shame  
I said love rescue me  
  
I've conquered my past  
The future is here at last  
I stand at the entrance  
To a new world I can see  
The ruins to the right of me  
Will soon have lost sight of me  
Love rescue me

And sing whatever song you wanted me to

Too many choices  
In New York I found a friend  
To drown out the other voices  
  
Voices on a cell phone  
Voices from home  
Voices of the hard sell  
Voices down a stairwell  
In New York  
Just got a place in New York  
  
In New York summers get hot  
Well into the hundreds  
You can't walk around the block  
Without a change of clothing  
  
Hot as a hair dryer in your face  
Hot as handbag and a can of mace  
New York  
I just got a place in New York

Forget how to sit still  
Tell yourself you will stay in

Feel like they own the place  
They got the airport, city hall  
Asphalt, asphalt  
They even got the police  
  
Irish, Italians, Jews and Hispanics  
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew  
Happily not like me and you

Still I'm staying on to figure out  
My midlife crisis  
  
I hit an iceberg in my life  
You know I'm still afloat  
You lose your balance, lose your wife  
In the queue for the lifeboat  
  
You got to put the women and children first  
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York  
  
New York  
New York  
New York, New York  
  
In the stillness of the evening  
When the sun has had its day

Like the tick tick tock of the eye of the clock

Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops  
When the summer shower's through  
So a voice within me  
Keeps revealing you, you  
  
Night and day  
You are the one  
Only you beneath the moon  
And under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter, baby, where you are  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Day and night  
Why is it so  
That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic gloom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Under the hide of me  
Though such a hungry yearning  
Burning inside of me  
This torment won't be through  
'til you let me spend my life making love to you

Every night I have the same dream  
I'm hatching some plot, scheming some scheme

The sirens are wailing but it's me that wants to get away

A young man running from what he didn't understand

I want to meet you where you are

As when the one you're hurting is your own

How low you'd stoop to make that call  
And you never knew  
What was on the ground till they mad you crawl  
And you never knew that  
The heaven you keep you stole  
  
Your catholic blues  
Your convent shoes  
Your stick on tattoos  
Now they're making the news  
Your holy war  
Your northern star  
Your sermon on the mount  
From the booth of your car  
  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Get up off your knees  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Leave me out of this  
  
So love is hard and love is tough  
But love is not what you're thinking of  
  
September  
Streets capsizing  
Spilling over  
Down the drain  
Shards of glass splinters like rain  
But you could only feel  
Your own pain  
October  
Talking getting nowhere  
November  
December  
Remember  
Are we just starting again  
  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Get up off your knees  
Please  
Please  
Please  
Please  
  
So love is big bigger than us  
But love is not what your thinking of  
It's what lovers deal  
It's what lovers steal  
You know I've found it hard to receive  
'Cause you my love I could never believe

Men of straw, snooker hall  
Words that build or destroy  
Dirt dry bone sand and stone

In a spiral staircase

Roman candle lightning lights up the sky  
  
In the cracked streets trampled under foot  
Sidestep, sidewalk

623,U2,Red Hill Mining Town,"From father to son  
The blood runs thin  
See faces frozen still  
Against the wind  
  
The seam is split  
The coal face cracked  
The lines are long  
There's no going back  
Through hands of steel  
And heart of stone  
Our labor day  
Has come and gone  
  
Yeah you leave me holding on  
In Red Hill town  
See lights go down, I'm  
  
Hanging on  
You're all that's left to hold on to  
I'm still waiting  
I'm hanging on  
You're all that's left to hold on to  
  
The glass is cut  
The bottle run dry  
Our love runs cold  
In the caverns of the night  
We're wounded by fear  
Injured in doubt  
I can lose myself  
You I can't live without  
  
Yeah you keep me holding on  
In Red Hill town  
See the lights go down on  
I'm hanging on  
You're all that's left to hold on to  
I'm still waiting  
Hanging on  
You're all that's left to hold on to, on to  
  
We'll scorch the earth  
Set fire to the sky  
We stoop so low, to reach so high  
A link is lost  
The chain undone  
We wait all day  
For night to come  
And it comes  
Like a hunter child  
  
I'm hanging on  
You're all that's left to hold on to  
I'm still waiting  
I'm hanging on  
You're all that's left to hold on to  
  
Love, slowly stripped away

As you jump to the street below  
But where can you go  
To leave yourself behind  
Alone in the spotlight  
Of this, your own tragedy  
  
I give you my love, love, love

What in the world am I to say  
There's nothing else to do  
He says he'll change the world someday

This morning I fell out of bed  
When I woke up to what he has said  
Everything's crazy  
But I'm too lazy to lie  
  
And what am I to do  
Just tell me what am I supposed to say  
I can't change the world  
But I can change the world in me  
If I rejoice

Sometimes you can't make it on your own  
  
I know that we don't talk  
I'm sick of it all  
Can you hear me when I  
Sing, you're the reason I sing  
You're the reason why the opera is in me  
  
Where are we now?  
I've got to let you know  
A house still doesn't make a home  
Don't leave me here alone  
  
And it's you when I look in the mirror  
And it's you that makes it hard to let go  
Sometimes you can't make it on your own  
Sometimes you can't make it  
The best you can do is to fake it  
Sometimes you can't make it on your own

Stand up in this dizzy world  
Where a lovesick eye can steal the view  
I'm gonna fall down if I can't stand up  
For your love

Stand up, this is comedy

But can you stand up to beauty, dictator of the heart  
I can stand up for hope, faith love

Stop helping God across the road like a little old lady  
Out from under your beds  
C'mon ye people  
Stand up for your love  
Love love love love love  
  
I gotta stand up to ego bet my ego's not really the enemy  
It's like a small child crossing an eight lane highway  
On a voyage of discovery  
Stand up to rock stars, Napolean is high heels  
Josephine, be careful of small men with big ideas  
Out form under your beds  
C'mon ye people  
Stand up for your love  
Love love love love love

And love is evolution's very best day

Summer dresses pass  
In the shade of a willow tree  
Creeps a crawling over me  
Over me and over you  
Stuck together with God's glue  
It's going to get stickier too  
It's been a long hot summer  
Let's get undercover  
Don't try too hard to think  
Don't think at all  
I'm not the only one  
Starin' at the sun  
Afraid of what you'd find  
If you took a look inside  
Not just deaf and dumb  
Staring at the sun  
Not the only one  
Who's happy to go blind  
  
There's an insect in your ear  
If you scratch it won't disappear  
It's gonna itch and burn and sting  
Do you want to see what the scratching brings  
Waves that leave me out of reach  
Breaking on your back like a beach  
Will we ever live in peace?  
'Cause those that can't do often have to  
Those that can't do often have to preach  
  
To the ones staring at the sun  
Afraid of what you'd find  
If you took a look inside  
Not just deaf and dumb  
Staring at the sun  
I'm not the only one  
Who's happy to go blind  
  
Intransigence is all around  
Military still in town  
Armour plated suits and ties  
Daddy just won't say goodbye  
Referee won't blow the whistle  
God is good but will he listen  
I'm nearly great  
But there's something I'm missing  
I left in the duty free  
Though you never really belonged to me  
  
You're not the only one  
Starin' at the sun  
Afraid of what you'd find  
If you stepped back inside  
I'm not sucking my thumb  
I'm staring at the sun  
Not the only one  
Who's happy to go blind

I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me  
I listen through your ears, through your eyes I can see  
  
And you are such a fool  
To worry like you do  
I know it's tough  
And you can never get enough

640,U2,The First Time,"I have a lover  
A lover like no other  
She got soul, soul, soul, sweet soul  
And she teach me how to sing  
  
Shows me colors when there's none to see  
Gives me hope when I can't believe  
That for the first time  
I feel love  
  
I have a brother  
When I'm a brother in need  
I spend my whole time running  
He spends his running after me  
  
When I feel myself going down  
I just call and he comes around  
But for the first time  
I feel love  
  
My father is a rich man  
He wears a rich man's cloak  
Gave me the keys to his kingdom coming  
Gave me a cup of gold  
  
He said I have many mansions  
And there are many rooms to see  
But I left by the back door  
And I threw away the key  
And I threw away the key  
Yeah, I threw away the key  
Yeah, I threw away the key  
  
For the first time  
For the first time  
For the first time  
  
I feel love

641,U2,The Hands That Built America,"Oh my love  
It's a long way we've come  
From the freckled hills  
To the steel and glass canyons  
  
From the stony fields  
To hanging steel from skies  
From digging in our pockets  
For a reason not to say goodbye  
  
These are the hands that built America  
Ah ah ah...America  
  
Last saw your face  
In a water colored sky  
As sea birds argue A long goodbye  
  
I took your kiss  
On the spray of a new lined star  
You gotta live in your dreams  
Don't make them so hard  
  
And these are the hands that built America  
Ah ah ah...America  
  
Of all of the promises  
Is this one we can keep  
Of all of the dreams  
Is this one still out of reach?  
  
Its early fall  
There's a cloud in the New York skyline  
Innocence...dragged across a yellow line  
  
These are the hands that built America  
These are the hands that built America  
Ah ah ah...America  
Ah ah ah...America

642,U2,The Playboy Mansion,"If coke  
Is a mystery  
Michael Jackson  
History  
If beauty is truth  
And surgery the fountain of youth  
What am I to do  
Have I got the gifts to get me through  
The gates of that mansion  
If OJ is more than a drink  
And a Big Mac bigger than you think  
If perfume is an obsession  
And talk shows confession  
What have we got to lose  
Another push and maybe we'll be through  
The gates of that mansion  
  
I never bought a lotto ticket  
I never parked in anyone's space  
The banks they're like cathedrals  
I guess casinos took their place  
Love come on down  
Don't wake her she'll come around  
  
Chance is a kind of religion  
Where you're damned for plain hard luck  
I never did see that movie  
I never did read that book  
Love come on down  
Let my numbers come around  
  
Don't know if I can hold on  
Don't know if I'm that strong  
Don't know if I can wait that long  
Till the colors come flashing  
And the lights go on  
  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for shame  
And though I can't say why  
I know I've got to believe  
  
We'll go driving in that pool  
It's who you know that gets you through  
The gates of the Playboy mansion  
Playboy mansion  
The Playboy mansion  
  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for pain  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for shame

644,U2,The Saints Are Coming,"There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the risin' sun  
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And, God, I know I'm one  
  
I cried to my daddy on the telephone  
How long now?  
Until the clouds unroll and you come down  
The line went  
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent  
  
I cried to my daddy on the telephone

I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply  
The saints are coming  
The saints are coming  
I say no matter how I try  
I realize there's no reply  
  
A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief  
How long now?  
Until the weather change condemns belief  
How long now?  
When the night watchman lets in the thief  
What's wrong now?  
  
Boom! Cha! Hey!

645,Ultravox,Accent On Youth,"What is this phase that I am going through  
O these precious years  
Please take my hand and let me breathe again  
Young depressive tears  
We stumble blindly chasing something new and something sinful  
You take my time you live my life for me  
What have I done to rate this penalty  
You suck me dry  
My body cries  
We stumble blindly chasing instant thrills and lasting memories  
  
Accent on youth  
Attention  
Ascends on you  
  
I scream with frustration and lost control  
Open for the blows  
My hands fall limp and hang down by my side  
Take my soul and go  
We stumble blindly chasing dancing lights and others' wishes  
  
(Chorus)  
Just let me close my eyes and slip away  
Dream a dream alone  
You give me just enough rope for the task  
Let this man alone  
We stumble blindly chasing silhouettes and vacant faces  
So well rehearsed our moves once so graceful turn against us  
We stalk dark passages, we're looking for that sweet surrender  
  
(Chorus)

646,Ultravox,All Stood Still,"The lights went out (The last fuse blew).  
The clocks all stopped (It can't be true).  
The program's wrong (What can we do?).  
The printout's blocked (It relied on you).  
The turbine cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Please remember to mention me,  
In tapes you leave behind.  
Chorus :  
We stood still.  
We all stood still.  
Still stood still.  
We're standing still.  
The screen shut down (There's no reply).  
The lifts all fall (A siren cries).  
And the radar fades (A pilot sighs).  
As the countdowns stall (The readout lies).  
The turbines cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Please remember to mention me,  
In tapes you leave behind.  
(Chorus)  
The black box failed (The codes got crossed).  
And the jails decayed (The keys got lost).  
Everyone kissed (We breathe exhaust).  
In the new arcade (Of the holocaust).  
The turbine cracked up.  
The buildings froze up.  
The system choked up.  
What can we do?  
Plese remember to mention me,  
In tapes you might leave behind.

"
647,Ultravox,Distant Smile,"Sometimes I find I drift away  
Behind a distant smile  
Light years ago I think someone spoke  
Quizzical glances behind cigarette smoke  
She drew the curtains at the end of the day  
And then we laughed because the room sailed away  
Fancy glitter in the summer arcades  
Then autumn leaves fall by a winter lane  
Piano echoes and the perfume still lingers  
But you fell through my fingers like sand  
With a distant smile  
A distant smile  
A distant smile  
Somehow I always seem to be  
Adrift in other times with a distant smile  
(???) the sound of the streets  
The city's glittering like diamonds in heat  
Our secret destination, touch down in the haze  
As the cameraman pans away  
Hey look, it's a long lost horizon  
Private oceans you can surface a sunrise in  
Hearts well ? dodging logic  
But nevertheless still permanently surprised  
Behind a distant smile  
A distant smile  
A distant smile  
Somehow I always seem to be  
Adrift in other times behind a distant smile  
You will see (?)

"
648,Ultravox,Dreams?,"When I was a boy, there's a dream that I had  
That a war if it's fought was for good against bad  
And I woke up to find that the world had gone mad  
And we'd all fall down  
And I feel like a child again sitting observing  
You're toying with power, your fingers are burning  
You're pushing so hard that the worms won't be turning  
We'll all fall down  
While you try to pretend you're a God upon high  
With your party ideals and your squeaky clean lies  
When it comes to the crunch you're not smarter than I  
And we'll all fall down  
If it's color or creed, or your old time religion  
Well, fighting for that shows a pure lack of vision  
The fight that we strive is the fight to survive  
And we'll all fall down  
Well, look in the mirror and what do you see  
An American, Russian, a soldier or me?  
When you've all pressed the buttons  
Just where will you be when we all fall down?  
It gets harder to see just what future's in store for us  
Hard to see through all the wool you pull over us  
Words that you give are just words to console us  
We'll all fall down  
And what will you do when you've pulled the release  
When the sound of the thunder has drowned out the pleas  
'Cos after all that was your idea of peace  
When we all fall down  
No sun for a world that once stood so tall  
No wind's going to blow and no rain's going to fall  
No flowers for graves, in fact no graves at all  
When we all fall down  

"
649,Ultravox,Hiroshima Mon Amour,"Somehow we drifted off too far  
Communicate like distant stars  
Splintered voices down the phone  
The sunlit dust, the smell of roses drifts, oh no  
Someone waits behind the door  
Hiroshima mon amour  
  
Riding inter-city trains  
Dressed in European grey  
Riding out to echo beach  
A million memories in the trees and sands, oh no  
How can I ever let them go?  
Hiroshima mon amour  
  
Meet beneath the autumn lake  
Where only echoes penetrate  
Walk through Polaroids of the past  
Futures fused like shattered glass, the suns so low  
Turns our silhouettes to gold  
Hiroshima mon amour

650,Ultravox,Hymn,"Give us this day all that you showed me  
The power and the glory  
Till my kingdom comes.  
Give us this day all that you showed me  
The power and the glory  
Till my kingdom comes.  
Give me all the storybook told me  
The faith and the glory  
Till my kingdom comes.  
And they said that in our time  
All that's good will fall from grace.  
Even saints would turn their face in our time.  
And they told us that in our days  
Different words said in different ways  
Have other meanings from he who says in out time:  
Give us this day all that you showed me  
And they said that in our time we would reap from their legacy  
  
We would learn from what they had seen in our time.  
And they told us that in our days  
We would know what was high on high  
  
We would follow and not defy in our time.  
Give us this day all that you showed me  
Faithless in faith  
We must behold the things we see.  
Give us this day all that you showed me

651,Ultravox,Just For A Moment,"Talking in the window as the light fades  
I heard my voice break just for a moment  
Talking by the window as the light fades  
I felt the floor change into an ocean  
We'll never leave here, never  
Let's stay in here forever  
And when the streets are quiet  
We'll walk out in the silence  
  
Listening to the movement that the night makes  
I let the room fade just for a moment  
Sitting in the shadows that the leaves make  
I felt the floor change into an ocean  
We'll never leave here, never  
Let's stay in here forever  
And when the streets are quiet  
We'll walk out in the silence  
  
Listening to the music the machines make  
I let my heart break just for a moment  
Listening to the music the machines make  
I felt the floor change into an ocean  
We'll never leave here never  
Let's stay in here for ever  
And when the streets are quiet  
We'll walk out in the silence

652,Ultravox,Love's Great Adventure,"Standing on my own  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I thought I had it all  
I didn't see the mystery  
I stood the test of time  
I took the step to find  
Love's great adventure  
  
I spoke a million words  
They didn't mean that much to me  
They rang around my head  
Like empty tuneless harmonies  
Love's great adventure mine  
  
Lying side by side  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I started to enjoy  
The poetry and symphonies  
I took it in my stride  
I hailed the Day i tried  
Love's great adventure  
  
A fool who couldn't see  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I couldn't understand  
That's how the game is meant to be  
Love's great adventure mine  
  
Standing on my own  
It didn't mean that much to me  
I thought I had it all  
I didn't see the mystery  
I stood the test of time  
I took the step to find  
Love's great adventure

653,Ultravox,Mine For Life,"[Chorus]  
A life as a stranger,  
Hands through a wire,  
Forbidden desires,  
Are mine for life.  
  
Looking from a spiral staircase,  
At a man with a suitcase,  
As he shades his eyes.  
Watching from a stained glass shelter,  
He bides his time and thinks,  
There must be more to life than this.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The poet reads his words out loud,  
To a make-believe crowd,  
In the quiet of his room.  
Careful where the tears are falling,  
He closed the book and cried,  
There must be more to love than this.  
See the boy on the walkway  
Where the young have their own say,  
And it screams from the wall.  
He's writing for the hundredth time there,  
I hate it all but,  
There must be more to hate than this.  
  
[Chorus x 4]

"
654,Ultravox,Mr X,"I found the perfect picture, of a perfect stranger.  
It looked as if, it were taken in the forties sometime,  
Judging by the style.  
He could be a killer or a blind man with a cane,  
Perhaps he died in a car crash, years ago.  
Right now, it's impossible to tell.  
I almost thought I saw him, standing, whistling on a bridge.  
I asked him the time, but when he turned around,  
I saw it wasn't him at all.  
I'm still searching.  
I'm still searching.  
I saw him in an airport, while he was sitting on a wing.  
And I waved to him, but I don't think he noticed me.  
I've got a funny feeling I know who he is.  
Mr. X (Repeat 14 times and fade)  

"
655,Ultravox,New Europeans,"In a quiet street washed by the rain, the room within the home.  
A lonely man sits cheek to cheek, with unique designs in chrome.  
The mellow years have long gone by, but now he sits alone.  
He has a brand new radio, but never turns it on.  
  
[Chorus]  
New Europeans.  
Young Europeans.  
New Europeans.  
  
A photograph of lovers lost, lies pressed in magazines.  
Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen.  
Their educated son has left, in search of borrowed dreams.  
His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On a crowded beach washed by the sun, he puts his headphones on.  
His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song.  
Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away.  
He's a European legacy, a culture for today.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young Europeans.

"
656,Ultravox,No Turning Back,"You think you're so safe and secure with your kind  
But don't be surprised if you're losing this time  
Learn to stand on your own  
Realise, and believe in yourself  
'Cause I won't be waiting  
Chorus:  
I hate to leave  
But there's no turning back  
You may think that I'm wrong but hear what I'm saying  
You have to believe  
There's no turning back  
I know where I belong, I can't go on waiting  
I watch as the tears fall colliding down your face  
Stand up to your fear now before it gets too late  
I won't be here at your side I pray  
Get a hold on yourself  
'Cause I won't be waiting

One small day  
  
How many times has it turned against you  
How many times will they walk away  
How many times have you let depression win the fight  
Oh my sentimental friend  
We'll walk as one again  
  
One day where I didn't die a thousand times  
Where I could satisfy this life of mine  
One small day  
One day where every hour could be a joy to me  
And live a life the way it's meant to be

How many times has it turned against you  
How many times will they walk away  
  
One day where I didn't die a thousand times  
Where I could satisfy this life of mine  
One day where every hour could be a joy to me  
And live a life the way it's meant to be  
  
One day where I wouldn't feel my senses die  
Where nothing made me hang my head and cry  
One day where I could see myself as others do  
Where I could feel the strength of love at hand  
  
One day where I didn't die a thousand times  
Where I could satisfy this life of mine  
One day where every hour could by a joy to me  
And live a life the way it's meant to be

658,Ultravox,Passionate Reply,"Suddenly you'll find  
Yourself waiting for a long time  
Your back's to the wall  
But now you must go  
Painting scenes from magazines  
Sucking breath from nicotine  
Standing tall against the crowd we sigh  
Taking turns on telephones  
Living lives in other homes  
Listening for the passionate replies  
Suddenly we find  
Ourselves talking for a long time  
Our voices are low  
But now you must know  
Giving all you have to give  
Taking all you've got to live  
Plotting all mistakes along the way  
Find it hard to take it all  
Reading names on other walls  
Writing down the words we tried to sing  
Suddenly you'll find  
Yourself waiting for a long time  
Your back's to the wall  
But now you must go  
Suddenly you'll find  
Yourself waiting for a long time

659,Ultravox,Paths And Angles,"Visions of men never known  
Never seen, never heard, never shown  
Characters lying in wait  
Responsible figures of fate  
With memories and faces as long as their hate  
  
Paths and the angles of light  
Find their way into my eye  
Recorded and logged for a time  
Some living, some loving, some dying  
  
There are factors re-arranged every time  
The phrases, the angles, so fine  
Sunken valleys and decades of crime  
Distant seasons  
A smile that was quoted as mine  
  
Paths and the angles of light  
Find their way into my eye  
Recorded and logged for a time  
Some living, some loving, some dying

660,Ultravox,Private Lives,"All the boys are wearing blue tonight.  
We'll thrive, we'll dive, how can we lose?  
All the strangers walk like you tonight.  
So tall, we fall for every move.  
  
We'll laugh and talk,  
Don't stop for breath,  
In these our private lives.  
We dance 'til dawn,  
As they beat the drums,  
For all our private lives.  
  
Close your eyes and use the melody,  
Who cares who stares under the light?  
See the shadow tailing me again,  
It shows, it glows, and it grabbed so bright.

"
661,Ultravox,Rage In Eden,"We sit and watch these lifeless forms  
Stark and petrified  
The high suspense of an empty stage drawing in clutching to its breast  
With murmured words we sigh and focus on the main facade  
  
Beyond the hard reluctant windows  
News from magazines  
We wrote their names on books we'd borrowed as if to bring us closer still  
And threw it all away to focus on the main facade  
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence  
But no-one could see the end  
  
And they were the new gods  
And they shone on high  
Their heavy perfume on the night sucked them down in red tide  
All is through the looking glass focus on the main facade  
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence  
But no-one could see the end  
  
Disciples of the new way  
Portraits in the new sand  
See when they run their longest mile holding caps in wet hands  
Eyes upon them try to focus on the main facade  
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence  
But no-one could see the end

A finger points to show a scene. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
Another face where mine had been. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
Another footstep where I once walked. (Take my hand)  
Take it all.  
  
[Chorus]  
You take my hand and give me your friendship.  
I'll take my time and send you my slow reply.  
Give me an inch and I'll make the best of it.  
Take all you want and leave all the rest to die.  
  
Reap the wild wind.  
  
A footprint haunts an empty floor. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
A fading coat that I once wore. (Take my hand. Take my hand.)  
Oh, desolation where I once lived.  
I have seen in times gone by.  
I have felt a different shadow on the wall,  
A stranglehold on a certain feeling.

663,Ultravox,Revelation,"  
I see it every day  
As children play  
There's a future, watching, waiting  
No-one can deny  
The reasons why  
We are hurting  
Much more than believing  
You're deceiving with all these bitter lies  
I've just got to let you know this time  
That we've seen through your disguise  
Politically motivated total mind control  
Just as I predicted  
The innocent grow stronger through it all  
Chorus:  
It's no lie, it's a revelation  
Open your eyes to the revelation  
Visions in your mind  
Unfolding in our time  
There's a new world out there calling  
We are justified  
Almost hypnotised  
We are leading  
Somehow we are changing  
Rearranging the lexicon of life  
And there's nothing left to change this time  
Here we all stand unified  
Together we have motivated absolute control  
And just as I imagined  
We all realised we had it all  
(Chorus)  
Side by side, to the revelation  
Open your mind to the revelation  
  

"
664,Ultravox,Sleepwalk,"Sleepwalk.  
  
Rolling and falling, I'm choking and calling,  
Name after name after name.  
  
Sleepwalk.  
  
Naked and bleeding, the streetlights stray by me,  
Hurting my eyes with their glare.  
  
Sleepwalk.  
  
Helplessly breaking, exchanging my faces,  
Destined, we had to collide.  
  
Sleepwalk!  
  
Taut on the outside, I'm crumpling and crawling,  
Watching the day drag away.  
Spiralling deeper, I can't feel my fingers,  
Rip round my throat as I dream.  
  
Dream!  
  
Sleepwalk.

"
665,Ultravox,Slip Away,"Enter me gently  
I break in the light  
Cover my eyes  
With the rags of my life  
Was I dreaming?  
Or did you say  
""The frontiers are falling  
It's time to be slipping away  
Let's slip away, let's slip away""  
All things fall from me  
The bonds and the veils  
All things blow by me  
My sorrows have sails  
Was I dreaming?  
Or did you say  
""The empires are fading  
It's time to be slipping away  
Let's slip away, let's slip away""  
What am I to do? Don't leave me  
What is there to say? I really  
We're just wasting time  
Let the night takes its place  
Color my eyes  
With the dusk of this wonderful day  
Let's slip away, let's slip away  
Letters from lovers  
Are lining my grave  
Some came too early  
And some came too late  
Were you speaking?  
Or did I say  
""The frontiers have fallen  
It's time to be slipping away""  
""As you call me  
My hands they fall open  
My mouth, it is frozen  
The [Incomprehensible] stumbles  
I'm falling slow-motion, dissolve""  

"
666,Ultravox,Slow Motion,"No reply  
I'm trying hard to somehow frame a reply  
Pictures, I've got pictures, and I run them in my head  
When I can't sleep at night  
Looking out at the white world and the moon  
I feel a soft exchange taking place  
Merging with the people on the brains (?)  
Whirling my face in conversation  
Slow motion  
Slow motion  
  
Hush, can you feel the trees so far away?  
Hush, can you feel the breeze of another day?  
When we held each other close in the night  
While we wheeled away in our own light  
Stepping sideways into our own time  
Such a simple way  
Slow motion  
Slow motion  
  
And we held each other close in the night  
While we wheeled away in our own light  
And some of us from another time  
And drifted away  
Slow motion  
Slow motion  

"
667,Ultravox,Some Of Them,"Some of them are changing day to day  
Some of them flicker then they fade  
Some of them are triggered off by any crazy thing  
Some of them are all that's left  
Some of them are just dead regrets  
Some of them are shining out through everything I see  
Some of them  
Some of them  
Some of them  
Some of them are brittle, some are sad  
Some of them are aching, some are glad  
Some of them are gone so long they're hard to recognise  
Stand close to the long parade  
Watch them passing by in their million ways  
Walk on through the evergreens  
Pass from scene to scene through all these yesterdays  
Some of them are friends just as they were  
Some of them are gentle, some can fret  
Some of them are crowding closer every passing year  
Some of them live in photographs  
Some of them still give me a laugh  
Some of them I've out-absorbed (?) as they're changing me  
Some of them  
Some of them  
Some of them  

"
668,Ultravox,Someone Else's Clothes,"Check out some memories I don't recognise  
Another country and another life  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
I find I'm strolling on a distant shore  
To meet someone I've never seen before  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh  
Chorus:  
I'm wearing someone else's clothes again  
Walking in the streets I know again  
Back in the old familiar glow again  
I'm wearing someone else's clothes  
Painting quiet pictures in my ear  
We're driving past without a wish to steer  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Driving underneath the deep blue sea  
I'm always surfacing in summer sheets  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh  
(Chorus)  
(Chorus)  
Transfer me into a Saturday crowd  
Or merge me back into a factory town  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
I'm opened up for such a splendid move  
I'm making ??? with someone, I don't know who  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh  
(Chorus)

"
669,Ultravox,Stranger Within,"Light comes through a crack in the door  
I tape up the windows once more  
Tight like a cold hand of steel  
Don't fear the stranger within  
Hands that petrify in the air  
Eyes catching things never there  
Sweet tension caught on my breath  
Don't fear the stranger within  
Watch every shape that escapes  
Scared to make the final mistake  
Speak to hear the sound of your voice  
Don't fear the stranger within  
Sit in the corner with your back to the wall  
Pray to your God with your head in your hands  
Your mask of fear is shrinking fast  
It's closing in more amour  
You stand on borrowed time, your sweating palms and chilling brow  
Your wide-eyed panic makes you laugh, you cry and laugh  
Freeze until the noise decays, a shuffle from behind a door  
Your throat is tight, it makes you choke and smoke and choke  
Eyes will grow accustomed to the dark, a stifled scream that won't come out  
There's nothing more to fear from the stranger within  
Don't fear the stranger within  
I feel the stranger within  
I see the stranger within  
Don't know the stranger within  
I am the stranger within  
I am the stranger within

"
670,Ultravox,The Voice,"Native these words seem to me  
All speech directed to me  
I've heard them once before  
I know that feeling  
Stranger emotions in mind  
Changing the contours I find  
I've seen them once before  
Someone cries to me  
Chorus:  
O O O O  
The look and the sound of the voice  
O O O O  
They try, they try  
O O O O  
The shape and the power of the voice  
O O O O  
In strong low tones  
Forceful and twisting again  
Wasting the perfect remains  
I've felt it once before  
Slipping over me  
(Chorus)  
Sweetly the voices decay  
Draw on the lines that they say  
I'd lost it once before  
Now it cries to me  
(Chorus)  

"
671,Ultravox,Visions In Blue,"Face in the window in the night  
Caught for a second by the light  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Only for you  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Visions in blue  
Read while the letters still remain  
Sip from the wine of youth again  
Oaths made in silence still return  
Only for you  
Cast like a shroud you're clutching on  
Visions in blue  
Catch aimless smiles from passers by  
Blistered and broken in reply  
Breath seems to mist the hazy view  
Only for you  
Tears coat your lifeless eyes with dew  
Visions in blue  
Visions in blue  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Face in the window in the night  
Caught for a second by the light  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Only for you  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Visions in blue

"
672,Ultravox,Waiting,"Move on as we step in time  
Strange words from the other line  
Edging forward, feeling strong  
Syncopate with the marching song  
Thoughts and dreams flick across your mind  
Fade away as you wait for your time to go  
You're waiting, waiting, waiting  
Looking back as you head for home  
Unsure if you walk alone  
Friends call from an open door  
Strange voice as you cross the floor  
Thoughts of home flick across your mind  
Slip away as you wait for your time to go  
You're waiting, waiting, waiting

"
673,Ultravox,We Came To Dance,"We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
The ties that bind us just slip away.  
We came to dance  
The piper calls out a different rhyme  
  
He cracks the whip and we step in time.  
Standing as the parade goes passing by  
I hear a voice around my cry.  
Like the sound of a distant drums  
Rejected and alone.  
  
A heart without a home  
Then someone said:  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance.  
Waiting as the panic grips my hand  
Hearing prose from high command  
  
Like a million times before  
No dignity or grace  
  
It's the price and not the race  
And someone said:  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance.  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
The ties that bind us just slip away.  
  
Take what you can  
They said take it while you may.  
But keep in mind penalty fits the crime  
  
And it deals no softened blow.  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...  
  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play...

"
674,Ultravox,We Stand Alone,"The words played on around our heads  
Perhaps we went too far  
We'll soldier on until the end again  
  
This clutching hand around my hand  
So pitiful and frail  
Makes bleeding hearts begin to beat again  
  
We stand in a different light  
That's cast upon this gigolo and gigolette  
We stand with a different frame around us now  
But when we talk we talk in time  
We shine with profiles so strong and so clear  
And when we move we move in time  
Won't fade like pictures that come back again  
  
Your propaganda touched my soul  
Those thin and cherished words  
A willing victim for the kill again  
  
We stand in a different light  
That's cast upon this gigolo and gigolette  
We stand with a different frame around us now  
But when we talk we talk in time  
We shine with profiles so strong and so clear  
And when we move we move in time  
Won't fade like pictures that come back again  
  
We stand in a different light  
That's cast upon this gigolo and gigolette  
We stand with a different frame around us now  
But when we talk we talk in time  
We shine with profiles so strong and so clear  
And when we move we move in time  
Won't fade like pictures that come back again

"
675,Ultravox,Western Promise,"Hai!  
Oh mystical East, on old postcards,  
Your childhood dreams and energies.  
Your temples' gardens, old world charm,  
An ancient culture, torn and scarred.  
This is my Western promise.  
Oh mystical East, you've lost your way,  
Your rising sun shall rise again.  
My Western world gives out her hand,  
A victor's help to your fallen land.  
This is my Western promise.  
Hai!  
Mystical East, all taxi-cabs,  
All ultra-neon, sign of the times.  
Your Buddha Zen and Christian man,  
All minions to messiah Pepsi can.  
This is my Western promise.

676,Ultravox,When The Scream Subsides,"(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.  
  
Yes, we had it all, had the key gripped in our hands.  
We could see the fall as a martyr understands.  
When the chorus calls there's no room for hope inside.  
Lose it all when the scream subsides.  
  
(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.  
  
Yes, we took the role of the lovers and the friends,  
And we played the parts 'til the words came to an end.  
But the tongues were tied in the passion and the pride.  
Wasted all when the scream subsides.  
  
(And we talked) Just the two of us.  
(All the time) Nothing serious.  
(We pretend) Time is on our side.  
('Til the end) When the scream subsides.

"
677,Ultravox,When The Time Comes,"So you think it's over  
So you think that down's  
The only way out  
A sad excuse for lovers  
With your head held high  
And your heart still full of doubt  
It's just like you to scorn  
The only one who'll mourn  
The day he doesn't love you  
Chorus:  
When the time comes I'll cry  
On the day you cut the thread  
When my heart tears I'll cry  
So you gave up giving  
And you sit and smile  
When the awkward silence falls  
Deny the life you're living  
Just a fleeting love  
That you only half recall  
It's just like you to make  
A passion turned to hate  
The day he doesn't love you  
(Chorus)  
Still we're here together  
Feeling helpless as our heaven turns to hell  
The taker and the giver  
Washed in anger  
When we think how far we fell  
It's just like you to take  
The step than makes the break  
The day he doesn't love you  
When the time comes I'll cry  
When the time comes I'll cry  
When the time comes I'll cry  
When the time comes I'll cry  

"
678,Ultravox,When You Walk Through Me,"It's warm tonight  
It rained tonight  
The windows are all open wide  
Can't see the clock to check the time  
Nothing is moving  
When you walk through me  
I turn around  
To switch the scene  
The room dives like a submarine  
I cross the carpet trying to leave  
Sometimes I can do it  
When you walk through me  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you walk through me  
I almost lose me  
It's so confusing  
When you walk through me  
When you walk through me  
Locations change  
The angles change  
Even the streets get rearranged  
While I'm swimming out  
Someone waves across a ??? room  
I take the train  
Or shine a shoe  
A dark horizon comes to view  
I get lost in the crossword clues  
Or check the time again  
  
(Chorus)  
It's warm tonight  
It rained tonight  
The windows are all open wide  
Can't see the clock to check the time  
Nothing is moving  
When you walk through me  
  
(Chorus)

"
679,Ultravox,While I'm Still Alive,"Playing the game  
With the chips on my shoulder  
Checking in the mirror  
As my coffee cup gets colder  
  
Stagger and swagger  
Combing my hair  
If tomorrow's not there  
Then at least today's all mine  
  
[Chorus]  
While I'm still alive  
While I'm still alive  
While I'm still alive  
  
Strutting my stuff  
I'm blagging the damage  
From coupling with headlines  
I was suckled on salvage  
  
The fighting's exciting  
The age is dramatic  
I'm crackling with static  
Just jiving to survive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take a stroll down the side roads, I know you want to  
A shock in the dark can be good for your heart, oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Scuffling along  
On the crest of a wave  
Laughing and grafting  
Or jerking and working  
  
Striking a match  
Where life is a gas  
I need the flash  
To make it all worthwhile  
  
[Chorus]

"
680,Ultravox,White China,"When pale turns to pink  
With a soft unnerving ease  
And all you've built around  
May just tumble to the ground  
We stand or fall  
With your future in another's hands  
We stand or fall  
When your life is not your own  
When white turns to red  
In the not too distant days  
Will force and misery  
Be the life you have to lead?  
We stand or fall  
With your children in anothers world  
We stand or fall  
When your town is not your own  
Chorus:  
White China  
White China  
When crimson takes a hold  
When the lights go down on all you've ever known  
When all you'll ever do  
Is worked out for you  
We stand or fall  
When the thoughts you have are not your own  
We stand or fall  
When the freedom slips away  
(Repeat chorus 3 times)  

"
681,Ultravox,Wide Boys,"I took a walk down New York avenue  
Wearing my latest disguise  
Enjoying the perfume of utter dismay  
I was effectively anesthetized  
Starving so arrogantly in jumble-sale clothes  
Evangeline hires out my throat  
We've got the streets of London wrapped in our beds  
Nagasaki in our own coats  
We're the wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah, go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent (???)  
Tired of being put down  
Broken-hearted my life (???) started  
Tired of being cut down  
All your illusions disillusioned (???)  
Wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah, go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent (???)  
We'll do some music plays the wrong side of nightmare  
Juke-box models collide  
The scent on the fire escaping blazing to the sun  
Embracing the old suicide pride  
I spent a few lifetimes making spinal connections  
Down on Einstein Boulevard  
I've to to walk a tightrope now the rampart is so high  
I swagger like a neon guitar  
With the wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah, go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent (???)  
Wide boys  
Up on the streets  
Wide boys  
Ah, go on and meet me  
Wide boys  
Delightfully unpleasant  
With the foxy adolescent (???)

"
682,Ultravox,Your Name (Has Slipped My Mind Again),"Something stops me from seeing too clear  
A misty haze floats round the room  
The murmurs make it hard to hear  
The voices and the words  
The days seem to drag away  
My speech is sparse and tends to slur  
I wonder what happened to my friend to day  
Can't hear the words  
  
[Chorus:]  
Your name has slipped my mind again  
Your name has slipped my mind again  
  
It's hard to focus in this light  
I'm growing warm and feeling dull  
The heartbeat pounds with vicious fright  
There's something to remember  
I clench my fist but feel no sensation  
The walls around me spin and sway  
A flash back image in my vision  
I remember  
  
(Repeat chorus 3 times)

"
683,Wham!,Heartbeat,"Wham!  
Another summer  
Another vacation is over  
A September morning,  
With the sun and the smell of the clover  
  
Down by the gate  
We sit and we watch all our friends go by  
And pretend we don't hear the bell,  
That rings through the summer sky.  
  
I was happy with the kiss that she gave me,  
It's just that happy was all she made me  
Happy that was  
Until I saw you  
  
[Chorus]  
Heart beat, heart beat,  
Why do you fail me now?  
You hurt me, desert me,  
In my darkest hour  
Heartbeat, heartbeat,  
Why do you keep me here?  
How could I help but admire her beauty?  
Standing on the line between desire and duty  
Heartbeat, heartbeat  
It will end in tears  
  
I need a lover,  
But love's such a dangerous place to be  
Oh, if we were meant for each other,  
Then why won't you answer me?  
  
Don't keep me waiting,  
You know that I long to be by your side  
We could even be together,  
Tonight  
  
I was happy with the kiss that she gave me  
But now there's nothing on Earth to save me  
Why should I care?  
I can't have you

684,Wham!,Last Christmas,"[Chorus:]  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away.  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away.  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance  
But you still catch my eye.  
Tell me, baby,  
Do you recognize me?  
Well,  
It's been a year,  
It doesn't surprise me  
(Merry Christmas)  
  
I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying, ""I love you,""  
I meant it  
Now I know what a fool I've been.  
But if you kissed me now  
I know you'd fool me again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away.  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away.  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
Oh, oh, baby.  
  
A crowded room,  
Friends with tired eyes.  
I'm hiding from you  
And your soul of ice.  
My god I thought you were someone to rely on.  
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart.  
A man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo.  
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away.  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
Last Christmas  
I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away.  
This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)  
A man under cover but you tore him apart  
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
Special...  
Someone...

685,Wham!,Nothing Looks The Same In The Light,"I watch you breathe,  
I cannot sleep,  
I touch your hair,  
I kiss your skin,  
And hope the morning sun won't wake you too soon.  
For when you wake,  
And look at me,  
You never know,  
You just might see,  
Another boy who crept in your room  
Take your time  
(that's what you told me)  
Take your time  
But I fell head first, and I just don't know what to do.  
  
[Chorus]  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
Only a fool like me would take to heart,  
The things you said you meant last night.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
I'll keep my feet firm on the ground.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
There's danger in a stranger,  
With a warm hand and a kiss so right.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
It's been a pleasure, see you around  
  
I watch the sun,  
Upon the sheets.  
I hear a car,  
Out on the street,  
And gently pull you close, it's over too soon.  
What can I do,  
But wait and see,  
Hold on to you,  
Please stay with me,  
Because you're the first, and I want to stay here with you.  
  
[Chorus]

"
686,Wham!,The Edge Of Heaven,"I would lock you up  
But I could not bear to hear you  
Screaming to be set free  
I would chain you up  
If I'd thought you'd swear  
The only one that mattered was me, me, me  
I would strap you up  
But don't worry baby  
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to  
It's too late to stop  
Won't the heavens save me?  
My daddy said the devil looks a lot like you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide you baby's eyes and we can,  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
When the passion dies,  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I'm like a maniac, at the end of the day  
I'm like a doggie barking at your door  
So come take me back to the place you stay  
And maybe we can do it once more  
  
You say I'm dangerous  
But don't worry baby  
I get excited at the things that you do  
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie  
'cause no-one does it better than me and you  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
Tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can,  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Please don't tell me lies  
It's just a matter of time before my heart is  
Looking for a home  
  
I ain't got no more worries  
I'm gonna spend some times with you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And don't you think that I know it  
  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
You tell me that my soul's forgiven  
Hide your baby's eyes and we can,  
You take me to the edge of heaven  
One last time might be forever  
Don't you tell me lies, because believe me baby  
One day you'll wake up on your own.  
  
I ain't got no more worries  
I ain't got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
Everyone's got their eyes on you  
I ain't got no more worries  
I ain't got no more time for you  
Loving you takes such courage  
And don't you think that I know it

687,Wham!,Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,"You put the boom boom into my heart,  
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts.  
Jitterbug into my brain,  
Goes bang bang bang till my feet do the same.  
  
But something's bugging me  
Something ain't right  
My best friend told me  
Where you were last night.  
  
Left me sleeping  
In my bed.  
I was dreaming  
But I should've been with you instead.  
  
[Chorus]  
Wake me up before you go go,  
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo.  
Wake me up before you go go,  
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high  
Wake me up before you go go,  
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo.  
Wake me up before you go go,  
Take me dancing tonight.  
I want to hit that high  
  
You get the gray skies outta my way,  
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day.  
Turn a mere spark into a flame,  
My beats per minute never been the same.  
  
'Cause you're my lady,  
I'm your fool.  
Makes me crazy  
When you act so cruel.  
  
C'mon baby,  
Let's not fight.  
We'll go dancing  
And everything will be alright.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cuddle up baby,  
Move in tight.  
We'll go dancing tomorrow night.  
  
It's cold out there  
But it's warm in bed.  
They can dance,  
We'll stay home instead.

What a way to live our lives.

The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
When I told you those lies  
Felt the spirit of love  
Demanding more than compromise  
Took a chance for a while  
Speaking in tongues  
That float us down rivers  
The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
Some people say that the way that we live  
Is out of this place  
And some people say that the way that we live  
Is blinded by fate  
All colours we chose

I was broken and doubting  
Love and my own sweet pride  
  
Come clean, come clean  
You know where you've been  
Slipping and stepping inside  
Come clean, come clean  
I know that's a dream  
Love is the divide  
  
Felt a rush from the mountain  
Oh lord, i pushed you aside  
I felt nothing but sadness  
I'll be alone tonight  
  
How can we lose? there's no laws to abuse  
There was never more passion in crime  
You took my hand, told me you'd understand  
There'd be time, so much time

A letter hit the pile

Like fingers in a dial  
Just then I stopped believing  
But only for a while  
And when I think that love was there

I had to phone someone so I picked on you  
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!

Look out your window I can see his light  
If we can sparkle he may land tonight

Inside emotions that you might not feel

Figures you mold like the sun  
Lovers can dream, devils can dream

Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy, my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
Beneath the sea of Hollywood where Frances used to reign  
They trade their deepest wishes for a part in someone's game  
Spirits die alone at night  
For life they cannot hold  
I would rather dance with you  
Than have a medal to show  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy, my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
Sun go east, sun go west  
Will I wear a medal again  
Sun go east, sun go west  
We can dance and bring on the rain  
  
Now I say love for love, not a space in time  
The strangest things can shatter kings and take away what's mine  
When it's raining in my heart  
I want the world to know  
I would rather dance with you  
Than have a medal to show  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy, my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
We are just everyday people, not a theatre company  
Everyone wants to join us, there's no fear in us you see  
It's me for you and you for me

Will I wear a medal again  
Sun go east, sun go west  
We can dance and bring on the rain

Nothin' but time  
And time won't give me time  
Won't give me time

A spirit breaking  
That's why I feel this way

When the angel sings  
There are greater things

Did you see him run through the streets and far away  
Did you see him run, did you see him fall  
Did his life flash by at the bedroom door  
  
Did you hear the news it came across the air today  
Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay  
Did you see him hide, did you see him crawl  
Does his life mean more than it did before  
  
Did you see that man running through the streets today  
Did you catch his face, was it 10538

To satisfy your intellectual need

Baby baby baby bring it to your knees

And I don't know how to stay  
I've got things that I must tell you  
That I don't know how to say  
The man behind these empty words  
Is crying out in shame  
Holding on to this sinking ship  
When nothing else remains  
  
[Chorus]  
All I want is everything  
Am I asking too much?  
All I want is everything  
Like the feel of your touch  
But all I have are yesterdays  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
It's hard to hold your head up  
When you're kneeling down to pray  
And talking don't come easy now  
When the words get in the way  
If you could see what's going on  
Behind these private eyes  
The truth would look so easy now  
But I'm running out of lies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You think the shadow of doubt  
Is hanging over my head  
It's just an angel  
Whose wings hide the sun  
And it's myself I betray  
I cannot wish this away  
Took my chance  
Now the damage is done

"
756,Def Leppard,Beyond The Temple,"Beyond the temple  
There lies a tomb with a king from long ago  
A traveler from a distant planet  
Ten thousand years or so  
The legend tells of an agin' man  
Whose city he built alone  
Till the pirates of our western world  
Tore it down stone by stone  
  
The clouds are gettin' heavy  
As he points unto the sky  
But with the guidance of his finger  
He let the lightning fly  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
He gathered up his people  
And he took them underground  
To the caves of silvery water  
Where they never could be found  
  
The king came to the surface  
Could not believe what he had found  
The temple left in ruins  
His city knocked to the ground  
  
He went back to his people  
Sad news he had to tell  
The only justice for the king  
Was to put these men in hell  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
His face showing sorrow  
His heart full of grief  
His life's work in ruins  
Destroyed by a thief  
  
His people just sit around  
His children just cry  
The king's mind is all confused  
Just wonderin' why  
  
The temple split in half  
And scattered through the desert  
The dust had risen in the air  
The race of people had to live in devastation  
Why wasn't he even there?  
  
Message from the gods to gather up his people  
The kingdom couldn't lose them there  
That's when all the gods and all are livin' peaceful  
Just a galaxy away  
  
The king rose up from underground  
To light the darkened sky  
Red lights, green lights, blue lights flashing  
It seemed a mile high  
  
As it lifted from the ground  
And soared into the air  
The king looked at what might have been  
A world that needed care  
  
A storm had risen quickly  
Across the take of hope  
Now there's no trace of the king  
Just a memory carved in stone  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price

Confusion in his mind, the blind leads the blind  
Yeah, Billy's got a gun, he's gonna shoot ya down  
He's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despise  
There's danger in the air  
  
Can you feel it in the air?  
Danger (Such a strange emotion)  
Can you feel it in the air?  
  
Oh he was locked inside a room without a door  
His innocence he suffered for  
In a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was right  
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true  
He's going underground to track that danger down  
Oh Billy, why you got that gun?  
  
Never give him an even break  
Gettin' caught is the chance you take  
It could be your last mistake  
(You could be so helpless)  
As a bird with a broken wing  
Like a sheep in a lion's den  
Gonna fall but you won't know when  
  
You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall  
And the ghastly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall  
Then a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too late  
  
As the rain came down on the crimson ground  
It was the hand of fate  
And a crowd of people gathered round, but Billy couldn't wait

758,Def Leppard,Breathe A Sigh,"Let me down slow an' easy  
'Cause there ain't nothin' I can do  
I hope and pray, my faith won't leave me  
When it comes down to me an' you  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin' next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Overflow of emotion  
And a hurt that'll never heal  
If you close the door forever  
The fate of pain is sealed  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin' next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
I more than long for your affection  
You tell me now that ain't so  
Not even gentle persuasion  
Is ever gonna let me go  
You lyin' next to me, yea  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Let me breathe  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?

And I wait for the flood

As I crawl to my knees  
And I beg your disease  
Taste the ice on your breath  
As you catch your death  
  
I close my eyes  
Embrace me  
Deliver me

Hey you, are you listening to me  
It's you that I can't believe in

Abandon me

That I won't see  
Deliver me

Around your head  
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed  
Don't forget to turn on the light  
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright  
Pour me out another phone  
I'll ring and see  
If your friends are home  
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome  
Can lend us a book we can read up alone  
  
And try to get it on like once before  
When people stared in Jagger's eyes  
And scored  
Like the video films we saw  
  
[Chorus:]  
His name was always Buddy  
And he'd shrug and ask to stay  
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid  
And turn her face away  
She's uncertain if she likes him  
But she knows she really loves him  
It's a crash course for the ravers  
It's a Drive-in Saturday  
  
Jung the foreman prayed at work  
That neither hands nor limbs would burst  
It's hard enough to keep formation  
Amid this fall out saturation  
  
Cursing at the Astronette 8  
Who stands in steel  
By his cabinet  
He's crashing out with Sylvian  
The Bureau Supply  
For ageing men  
  
With snorting head he gazes to the shore  
Which once had raised a sea  
That raged no more  
Like the video films we saw

It's a Drive-in Saturday [repeat]

Close your eyes don't run and hide  
Easy love is no easy ride  
Just wakin' up from what we had  
Could stop good love from going bad

779,Def Leppard,Gift Of Flesh,"I am all destiny, a trade, a grain of sand  
I take the throat of innocence and leave decay  
I stain the way for all to see  
  
No fear, no voice, no reason  
In god no guiding light  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held high  
  
Indulge and multiply and sacrifice  
As lack of breath chokes underground  
Divulge degenerate, the darker side  
From windows watch the screaming sky  
  
No fear, no voice, no reason  
In god no guiding light  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held high  
  
From the truth comes all the shame  
The curse of flesh just takes it aim  
On hallowed ground and tortured sky  
Walk in fear with spirits high

I haven't been there today  
It's time we went for a ride  
Come on and step right inside  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
  
Darkness our sole destination  
Daylight our only intention  
White lightning brightens the sky  
Can't tell we're flying so high  
Rest now and don't be afraid  
Can't you see we've got it made  
Just cause I'm not going far  
That doesn't mean that we can't reach the stars  
  
Too many people have waited

Break out before it's too late  
Now come and lay down by my side  
Let all the thoughts slip away

This time, if we just fight  
Innocence starts tonight  
If we can heal it

Like a knife they try to bleed us  
And they cut us real slow

Just go  
You hide behind your mask of desperation  
Go

You have no dignity  
I have no sympathy  
You are my enemy  
But I can't see you  
  
No matter where you run  
Thy kingdom will be done  
A rocket to the sun  
Is where I see you  
  
Endless senses get ecstatic  
Overflow is automatic  
Feel the need to feel erratic  
Don't deny it let it flow  
  
So go,  
Just go  
Just go  
You hide behind your mask of desperation  
Go  
Just go  
Just go  
I won't surrender to this fake salvation

Have you ever needed someone so bad  
  
And to the girl I gotta have  
I gotta have you baby  
  
There you go, midnight promises again, yeah  
But they're broken by the dawn  
You want to go further, faster every day, baby  
But in the morning you'll be gone  
And I'm alone  
  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every dream I dream is like  
Some kinds rash 'n' reckless scene  
To give out such crazy love  
You must be some kind of drug  
And if my time don't' ever come  
For me you're still the one  
Damned if I don't, damned if I do  
I gotta get a fix on you  
  
[Chorus]

What's this I fear that's followin' me?

I can not stand it, I'm gettin' outta here  
  
You'd better beware now  
You'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner  
  
The rain is falling around my feet  
The night is calling on this well-lit street  
People in doorways just stand and stare  
Castaway shadows that really aren't there  
  
You'd better beware now  
You'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner

But there's somebody home  
Better watch out when  
We're all alone

Would you call it a sin  
With the burden of proof  
Breathing under my skin  
Like a ghost from the past

And the name that you scream  
When you're dreaming out loud

And your pain, it flows like wine  
As my subconscious reaps your mind  
  
I stretch to kiss the burning sky  
And watch the waking beauty cry

Is it such a crime to watch the sunset for the last time  
Until we meet again, goodbye, farewell, amen

808,Def Leppard,Let Me Be The One,"Something in the way you move  
Let's me get too close to you  
I tremble when I look at your face  
And I want all the world to see  
Tonight the world belongs to me  
Touch me with your animal grace  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
And feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
  
Burnin' in the afterglow  
We catch the wind and let it go  
Washed away like words in the sand  
A passion that's so physical  
Electric and untouchable  
Don't want to let it slip through my hands  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
And feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
  
Don't let this dream pass by  
Just spread your wings and fly  
Reach out and touch  
Let your heart just breathe me in  
I'll be your oxygen  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
Feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
Oh, oh  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one

810,Def Leppard,"Long, Long Way To Go","You held my hand and then you slipped away  
And I may never see your face again  
So tell me how to fill the emptiness inside  
Without love, what is life?  
And anyone who knew us both can see  
We always were the better part of me  
I never wanted to be this free  
And all this pain, when does it go away?  
  
Then every time I turn around  
And you're nowhere to be found  
I know  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
Oh, I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye  
To all I ever knew, to you  
To you  
  
From memory there is no hiding place  
Turn on the TV and I see you there  
In every crowd there's always someone with your face  
Everywhere, trying not to care  
  
Then every time I turn around  
And you're nowhere to be found  
I know  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye  
To all I ever knew  
  
To you I wish you everything  
And all the best that life can bring  
I only hope you think of me sometimes  
Oh, and even though I feel the pain  
I know that I will love again  
The time will come  
Oh, and I'll move on  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you

Gotta long way to go

Oh I should've known from the start  
That, you'd go and tear it apart

You always live to tell the tale  
You take me up, you bring me down  
Without a touch, without a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
Love, love why do I keep searching high and low?  
You take me in your arms and let me go  
  
Oh how long must it be until you, come run back to me can't you see  
I got no release from the pain just to see you again  
  
You never lose, you never fail  
You always live to tell the tale  
You take me up, you bring me down  
Without a touch, without a sound

When you make love, do you look in your mirror?  
Who do you think of?  
Does he look like me?  
Do you tell lies?  
And say that it's forever?  
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?  
Ooh babe  
Ooh yeah  
When you're alone, do you let go?  
Are you wild 'n' willing or is it just for show?  
Ooh come on  
  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy  
I know you think that love is the way you make it  
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it  
No!

It's what I need  
When I'm with you are you somewhere else?  
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?  
When you wake up will you walk out?  
It can't be love if you throw it about  
Ooh babe  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy

813,Def Leppard,Love Don't Lie,"Time  
Just watching the time slippin' away  
Gimme a sign  
Where do you go when you can't find the way  
  
So we watch and we wait  
And we crawl and we kneel  
If you know who you are  
Then you know how to feel  
In time  
Maybe temptation is all that you need  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
It's not as easy as it seems  
When you can't even sleep in your dreams  
Love don't lie  
And that's the truth  
Look me straight in the eye for the proof  
That love don't lie  
Yeah, love don't lie  
  
Out in the cold  
With a love that burns like the sun  
You've stolen my soul  
So justice would seem to be done  
  
So we hope and we pray  
And we live and we learn  
If we know where we are  
Then we know where to turn  
In time  
Maybe persuasion is all that you need  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
It's not as easy as it seems

814,Def Leppard,Me And My Wine,"Well I'm down in the alley of Sally and I'm feeling my way  
And it's four in the morning, I don't have a lot I can say  
I know I'm looking for some satisfaction  
But there ain't much news  
Got some walking from a back reaction  
I'm hanging down and loose  
  
Me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is I'm doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now my brain and my body are runnin' on different rails  
And I died and just say hi what if all else fails  
Oh I woke up in a subway station  
Lying half dead on the floor  
I don't remember anything  
What happened the night before  
  
Oh me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is I'm doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now listen  
My hair's a real mess, I feel and look like a joke  
And there's a hole in my jeans, I just ran right out of smokes  
You know I'd like to get to know you  
But I ain't got the time  
I'm finding it harder and harder  
To make this damn thing rhyme  
  
Just me and my wine  
Well just me and my wine  
You know that I'm doing fine  
Well just me and my wine  
Thank you

"
815,Def Leppard,Misty Dreamer,"The sun that is rising is glistening down on the hill  
The pool of confusion is silently still  
The thoughts of another keep runnin' through my mind  
As I search for the answer, it's never easy to find  
  
The prophet stood on the hill and firmly he gripped his sword  
As the angels of wisdom were singing a heavenly chord  
So I look back and wonder if I should be asking for more  
As a traveller in limbo who's washed up onto the wrong shore  
  
In the morning when I wake up  
And the story starts to break up  
Then it's plain to see  
What's wrong with me  
So the curtains they are drawn back  
And my mind is simply torn back  
To reality, you see, to me, I'm just a misty dreamer  
  
I slipped by the waterslide  
And I thought I heard my true love screamin'  
So I opened my eyes and shook my head  
And I realized I was only dreamin'  
  
So close your eyes and drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you  
  
Your conscience guided by a light  
Your memory won't be here tonight  
The sorrow that eyes are showing  
Doesn't hide your spirit flowing  
  
So close your eyes and drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you  
  
Drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you

An unchained sex machine  
Slippin' slidin', electric glidin'  
And boy she was mean

High class dealer, sippin' her tequila  
Comin' on pretty strong  
Real love stealer, rebel rousin' squealer  
She said go but I said no  
  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
  
Waiting at the back door, couldn't take it anymore  
Didn't know where she'd been  
She looked pretty neat, turnin' on the heat and only seventeen  
Seventeen  
Windin' her up, bringin' her down, she wanted it just the same  
Said stick around  
That's when I found I only had myself to blame  
  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
  
High class dealer, sippin' on tequila  
Comin' on really strong  
Rhythm stealer, rattle off squealer

818,Def Leppard,On Through The Night,"The wait is done, the battle's won  
So count the cost before you run  
Cause on and on your time was power  
The clock on the wall ticks away the hours  
Come on down, you're flyin' high  
You'll never win if you never try  
Stop the hate and carry the load  
Come on, get this show on the road  
  
On through the night, you can't stop me now  
On through the night, you won't stop me anyhow  
  
The stakes are high and gettin' higher  
I'm flat on my face and you call me liar  
I'm watching you, you're watching me  
You're watching every move that I can see  
My reputation's still at stake  
I play it safe for safety's sake  
Your ego and your promises  
Are gonna fade again and again  
  
On through the night, you won't stop me now  
On through the night, you won't stop me anyhow  
Not anyhow  
  
All you want to hear is the audience applause  
You can't get on stage for a country clause  
And the road ahead seems a little rough  
If you want to know my feelings I'd say that's tough  
And that's tough  
  
Your wheels ain't turnin', you're out of gas  
You pay by check but they take cash  
Two roads ahead but which to take  
And you can't see it's your mistake  
They're waitin' for you  
They're waitin' for me  
And what seems like eternity  
It's all tradition, it'll get you yet  
In rock'n'roll there's no safety net  
  
On through the night, you can't stop me now  
On through the night, you can't stop me anyhow  
On through the night, goin' on and on, on and on  
On through the night, you can't stop me anyhow  
No no not anyhow

Sweet innocent fate will be our company  
  
Ahh, Ahhh, Ahh, Ahhh

That I bring to you  
A beacon of light  
To see you through  
For time is on our side  
And a holy man  
Does say to me  
To always to be blind  
And never to see  
It's not the way he planned it  
Oh no  
  
The time has come to gather up your thoughts  
For you have said your piece  
The lords of light will change this land  
From famine into feast  
The buildings that once stood tall  
Have crumbled to the ground  
The silver warriors who came in force  
Are nowhere to be found  
  
Time is the essence the priests do say  
To restore your faith in man  
For the job you do and the role you play  
Will help rebuild this land  
Through empty streets and dusty fields  
We'll fight for what we need  
Protected by our swords and shields  
We can replant the seed  
  
The roads ahead are long and winding  
On which the bandits thrive  
But we have the power of finding  
Illusion to keep us alive  
So through the valleys and over the hills  
We'll march and sing in rhyme  
We'll fight until we lose our will  
For essence is our time  
  
The sun the moon  
The darkened sky  
The morning dew  
Reflecting in my eye  
The rising mist  
The dampened earth  
Are just reminders of what life's worth  
Whoah yeah  
Whoah yeah  
Whoah yeah  
  
And with this message  
That I bring to you  
A beacon of light  
To see you through  
For time is on our side  
For time is the essence

Does it help to forget  
Do you know what you started  
When you lit the fuse of regret  
  
There's not a reason why you've come undone  
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on  
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land  
  
Cause you're living on a paper sun  
Blind to all the damage done  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the tide to turn  
Living on a paper sun  
You can't hide and you can't run  
All your dreams have come and gone  
Living on a paper sun

And does the fear make you run  
Is the anger inside of you  
A gift from father to son  
  
I don't believe in you, you've come undone  
I don't believe in what you do, this can't go on  
I don't believe in you as I walk this broken land

Living on a paper sun  
You can't hide and you can't run  
All your dreams have come and gone  
Living on a paper

And like no other you feed the fire  
  
There's not a reason why you've come undone  
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on  
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land

Hey, babe, lets go out tonight  
You like me, and I like it all  
We like dancing, and we look divine  
You love bands when they play it hard  
You want more, and you want it first  
Put you down, say I'm wrong  
You tacky thing, you put them on  
  
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress  
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess  
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?  
Hot tramp, I love you so!  
  
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress  
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess  
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?  
Hot tramp, I love you so much!  
  
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess  
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test  
You've got transmission and a live wire  
Got your cue lines and a handful of ludes  
You wanna be there when they count up the dues  
And I love your dress  
You're a juvenile success  
Because your face is a mess  
So how could they know?  
I said, how could they know?  
To what you wanna know  
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile  
Where'd you wanna go? (rebel rebel)  
Can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too  
'Cause you've torn your dress (rebel rebel)  
And your face is a mess  
Ooo, ooo, your face is a mess (rebel rebel)  
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know? (rebel rebel)  
How could they know? Hah  
Hah-hah

827,Def Leppard,See The Light,"Well I came down here from manhattan  
To see the lights on the mall  
But when I got here early this morning  
Well I couldn't see any at all  
So I walked a little further  
And much to my surprise  
There was a hot cool woman  
In a chevy staring into my eyes  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
Alright  
She said now don't walk any further  
Just jump into my car  
And we can head on down the highway  
But you'd better not go too far  
Cause my daddy he's big business  
So we've gotta be back by tonight  
But we can still have some fun now  
If we head on downtown to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
Well, we ended up in this cafe  
'Bout twenty-five minutes to one  
See, she took me to this nightclub  
And the music went on and on  
Well we were set down to get coffee  
When in walked her old man  
No matter how we tried to explain it well  
We couldn't make him understand  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights

829,Def Leppard,Sorrow Is A Woman,"You're always pretending to be  
Someone who prefers to be free  
You think you can fool me with your lyin' eyes  
But what is this game that you play  
When all that your trying to say  
Is that your lonely, in need of a friend  
  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
And can't you see that it's true  
There's someone as lonely as you  
Trying so hard, so hard to get through  
And why can't everyone see the way that it really should be  
Why hide your feelings and suffer the pain  
  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
You know she'll make you feel sad

832,Def Leppard,Stay With Me,"[Originally by The Faces]  
  
In the mornin' don't say you love me,  
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door  
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter  
Since when I saw you down on the floor.  
  
Won't need too much pursuadin'  
I don't mean to sound degradin',  
But with a face like that you got nothin' to laugh about.  
Red lips, hair and fingernails,  
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel  
Lets go up stairs and read my Tarot cards  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
  
So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me  
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door  
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne,  
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd gonna stay with me  
Sit down, get up, get out.

833,Def Leppard,To Be Alive,"I know you don't believe it  
Like I believe it  
Oh no, it's not your fault  
You sit alone inside a room  
Wait for the world to come to you  
They never do  
  
It must be something that you can't let go  
It hurts that you won't let me know  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And then in conversation  
I love the way you mention  
Nothing's ever gone your way  
With a hammer in your hand  
You spell out a master plan  
We never learn  
  
It must be somebody holding your heart  
Something that tears us apart  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And I don't think that it's right  
To let love pass by  
Any time of life  
It's good to be alive  
  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
Yes, every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help what I feel  
But it sure feels real  
I wanna hold on to this moment  
Cause babe it sure feels right  
To be alive  
To be alive  
To be alive

"
834,Def Leppard,Tomorrow,"I'm here to testify  
I can't remember why  
Complete or justify my situation.  
  
I don't remember when and I can only half pretend,  
A case of now and then, I just need someone.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way but there?s the only way, lead the way.  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna take a ride, I wanna kiss the sky  
I just found out, I cant wait until tomorrow comes.  
  
Spoke out on compromise, just the ego telling lies.  
Confides and then defies, in case you?'re waiting.  
Guess that it's a time for change  
Remain but change the name.  
This game is where to aim.  
I hear the charge, boy.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way, but there?s the only way, lead the way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's liberating, but when it rains it pours,  
Degenerating, ain't gonna fight no more.  
  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna take a ride, I wanna kiss the sky  
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.

"
835,Def Leppard,Too Late For Love,"Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring  
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing  
And the lady 'cross the street she shuts out the night  
There's a cast of thousands waiting  
As she turns out the light  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtain starts to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
  
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you  
Are the actor and the clown they're waiting for their cue  
And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool  
But when it comes to playing life  
She always plays the fool  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
Is it all too late  
Much too late  
Can't you see it's all too late  
It's too late  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love

836,Def Leppard,Torn To Shreds,"I don't want to fall in love  
But it's been taken out of my hands  
And right now I realize  
I don't want to say goodbye  
  
I miss you more than words can say  
They never turn out right  
But here goes anyway  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere  
But I know you're out there somewhere  
These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds  
  
I can't help the way I feel  
But somethin's got a hold of my heart  
It hurts that I can't let go  
Now I just want to let you know  
  
I need you more than words can say

But here goes anyway

Got me feelin' torn to shreds  
  
If I ever get myself together  
And it takes whatever it takes  
To get myself back to you  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere

These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds

837,Def Leppard,Turn To Dust,"The concentration drifts in out of me  
Conversation slides away  
Turn and face the change in apathy  
Take a rise to fall  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust  
  
Slave or sympathy, it atrophies  
Save but ancient hearts  
Hiding scars and knives in symphonies  
Still we rise to fall  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?

838,Def Leppard,Two Steps Behind,"Walk away if you want to  
It's OK, if you need to  
You can run, but you can never hide  
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you can't have it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Whatever you do)  
I'll be two steps behind you  
(Wherever you go)  
And I'll be there to remind you  
That it only takes a minute of your precious time  
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind  
  
Take the time  
To think about it  
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it  
Take a look around and see what you can find  
Like the fire that's burning up inside me  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you can't have it all

There's a magic running through your soul

You got to take it on the chin  
Stay undefeated!

Your mind is breakin', it's such a shame  
Warchild, your body's broken  
Your woman's taken, it's not a game  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory, shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams  
  
Warchild, I used to love you  
The whole world loved you, we used to care

So all you do now is just sit n' stare

Your lady's waiting, she's hesitating  
Not knowing why

843,Def Leppard,Wasted,"Well I've been lying awake all night just thinking of you  
But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view  
I've got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills  
And I know that I'm leading a life that kills  
  
(Wasted) I've wasted my time  
(Wasted) I'm shooting a line  
(Wasted) I'm stuck in a hole  
(Wasted) I'm losing control  
  
And I've been meaning to call, I've been wanting to phone  
You see I don't like the thought of leaving you here alone  
Well I've seen things down here that are fit for a queen  
I've seen things down here that should never be seen

844,Def Leppard,Waterloo Sunset,"Dirty old river, must you keep rolling  
Flowin' into the night  
People so busy, making me dizzy  
Taxi light shines so bright  
But I don't need no friends  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset  
I am in paradise  
Every day I look at the world from my window  
But chilly, chilly is the evening time  
Waterloo sunset's fine  
Waterloo sunset's fine  
  
Terry meets Julie at Waterloo Station  
Every Friday night  
But I am so lazy, I don't like to wander  
I stay at home at night  
But I don't feel afraid  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset

845,Def Leppard,When The Walls Came Tumbling Down,"On the first day of the first month in some distant year  
The whole sky froze golden  
Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb  
While the others told of a final retribution  
A terrible revenge of the Gods  
But we understood the grand finale  
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before  
So all that was left was  
All the women were captured and chained  
And national suicide was proclaimed  
And new America fell to the ground  
And all the children lay crippled lame  
But all the nations came together  
In fear of the thought of the end  
No more would we fight in the streets  
No courage had we to defend  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
A blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its place  
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race  
The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend  
A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Nobody made a sound  
(Down, down, down)  
Down

846,Def Leppard,Where Does Love Go When It Dies,"Could you ever steal a prayer to deny your God  
Could you ever buy your love and not count the cost  
Could you ever take a life when all was lost  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Could you bite the hand that feeds you and then ask for more  
Could you kiss the wound that bleeds spit it on the floor  
Could you open up your heart then close the door  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Every word you whisper  
All the tears you hide  
You die for love when it's alive  
But where does love go when it dies  
  
If you came across your dream would you walk on by  
Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die  
And is there room inside your mind for one more try  
And would it ever be enough  
  
I watch the time go rushing by it's like an ocean wave  
Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave  
You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light  
And there ain't no prayer that's gonna save you now  
  
If you woke up from your sleep blood on your hands  
Would you wash the pain away no one understands  
There must be someone out there who can help you breathe again  
And would it ever be enough

Oh the jets ain't jumping cause the clouds too low

Who do you love is it him or is it me  
Hey hey I wanna know  
  
I called Detroit city on the telephone  
The man on the line tell me you ain't home  
I wanna know  
Who's that voice  
What's  
There's a deep red glow in the early morning sky  
Who do you love better make up your mind  
  
Don't wanna buy love  
Don't wanna try love  
I just want your love babe  
  
Hey alright  
  
Well its five in the morning and the place is dead  
I'm gonna rest my body on a empty bed  
Who do you love

What's your game  
Make up your mind are you his are you mine  
When you get back I ask you one more time  
Hey hey  
Hey hey

848,Def Leppard,Women,"In the beginning God made the land  
Then He made the water and creatures, then He made man  
He was born with a passion, love and hate  
A restless spirit with a need for a mate  
But there was something that was missing, something lost  
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost  
One part love, one part wild  
One part lady, one part child  
  
I give you  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
  
And in the garden, lust began  
The animal instinct, the wanton man  
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite  
And fillin' with emotion he took a bite  
It was one part love, one part child  
One part lover, one part wild  
  
I give you  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
  
Skin on skin, let the love begin  
Women  
  
It was one part love, one part wild  
One part lover, one part child  
A whole lotta fire, a little bit of ice  
A whole lotta something you can't sacrifice  
  
I give you  
Hair, eyes, skin on skin  
Legs, thighs  
What's that spell  
  
Women, women, oh, oh  
Women, women, callin' every girl  
Women, women, all around the world  
Women, women, oh we can't live without them  
Women, women

And nothin' seems to matter  
I'm the one who's holding on  
  
It's alright to be wrong  
All we need's a little time

You can't always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You just might find  
You'll get what you need  
  
I went down to the demonstration  
To get my fair share of abuse  
Singing ""we're gonna vent our frustrations""  
""And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse""  
  
You can't always get what you want

To get your prescription filled  
I was standing in line with Mister Jimmy  
And man, did he look pretty ill  
We decided that we would have a soda  
My favorite flavor, was cherry red  
I sung my song to Mister Jimmy  
And he said one word to me, and that was ""dead""

852,Def Leppard,Ziggy Stardust,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly  
And The spiders from Mars, he played it left hand  
But made it too far  
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band  
  
Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo  
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling  
He could leave 'em to hang  
Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan  
  
So where were the spiders  
While the rats tried to break our balls  
Just the beer light to guide us  
So we bitched about his fans  
And should we crush his sweet hands, oh  
  
Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo  
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz  
With God given ass  
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar  
  
Making love with his ego  
Ziggy sucked up into his mind  
Like a leper messiah  
When the kids had killed the man  
I had to break up the band, oh  
  
Oh yeah, ooooooh  
Now, Ziggy played guitar

853,Depeche Mode,A Pain That I'm Used To,"I'm not sure what I'm looking for anymore  
I just know that I'm harder to console  
I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me  
But the key is a question of control  
  
Can you say what you're trying to play anyway  
I just pay while you're breaking all the rules  
All the signs that I find have been underlined  
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled  
  
[Chorus]  
All this running around, well it's getting me down  
Just give me a pain that I'm used to  
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive  
You just need to achieve something that rings true  
  
There's a hole in your soul like an animal  
With no conscience, repentance, oh no  
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise  
Devils feed on the seeds of the soul  
  
I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real  
No mistaking the faking, I care  
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there  
On a note full of hope not despair

854,Depeche Mode,A Photograph Of You,"What good is a photograph of you  
Every time I look at it  
It makes me feel blue  
  
What use is a souvenir  
Of something we once had  
When all it ever does is  
Make me feel bad  
  
I wish I could tear it up  
But then again I haven't the guts  
I wish I could throw it on the fire  
I wish I could  
But to say I would  
I'd be a liar  
  
What good is a color print  
Of a little baby doll  
When just one little glance  
Is enough to make me feel dull  
  
I hoped I would misplace it  
But then I take such good care of it  
I wish it would disappear  
I say I wish  
But then I relish  
It being here

855,Depeche Mode,A Question Of Lust,"Fragile  
Like a baby in your arms  
Be gentle with me  
I'd never willingly  
Do you harm  
Apologies  
Are all you seem to get from me  
But just like a child  
You make me smile  
When you care for me  
And you know  
It's a question of lust  
It's a question of trust  
It's a question of not letting  
What we've built up  
Crumble to dust  
It is all of these things and more  
That keep us together  
Independence  
Is still important for us though (we realise)  
It's easy to make  
The stupid mistake  
Of letting go (do you know what I mean)  
My weaknesses  
You know each and every one (it frightens me)  
But I need to drink  
More than you seem to think  
Before I'm anyone's  
And you know  
It's a question of lust  
It's a question of trust  
It's a question of not letting  
What we've built up  
Crumble to dust  
It is all of these things and more  
That keep us together  
Kiss me goodbye  
When I'm on my own  
But you know that I'd  
Rather be home  
It's a question of lust

It's just a question of time  
Well now you're only fifteen  
And you look good  
I'll take you under my wing  
Somebody should  
They've persuasive ways  
And you'll believe what they say  
It's just a question of time  
It's running out for you  
It won't be long until you'll do  
Exactly what they want you to  
I can see them now  
Hanging around  
To mess you up  
To strip you down  
And have their fun  
With my little one  
It's just a question of time  
It's running out for you  
It won't be long until you'll do  
Exactly what they want you to  
Sometimes I don't blame them  
For wanting you  
You look good  
And they need something to do  
Until I look at you  
And then I condemn them  
I know my kind  
What goes on in our minds  
It's just a question of time  
It should be better  
It's just a question of time  
It should be better with you  
It's just a question of time

I was there when you wanted me least

Through your losses and gains  
I didn't see much happiness or pain  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't fill that hole  
Alone  
  
I saw you at your best  
I knew you at your worst  
I couldn't tell if you were blessed or cursed  
  
There's a thin grey line  
Between the black and white  
It's evidently hard to find at night  
  
I couldn't save your soul  
I couldn't even take you home  
I couldn't play that role  
Alone  
  
Now it's too, too late for  
words That should have been said  
Long ago

The sun is high and the field lies fallow  
My tongue is tied and my body aching  
Now I'm opened wide and afraid of breaking  
  
The food is hot and the table's ready  
But the stomach knots make my hands unsteady  
So I take to pacing and up and down the room  
While my heart keeps racing and my mind's consumed  
  
I just want to be part of the light  
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes  
I just want to be part of the light  
Of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes  
  
The bed is made and the candles burning  
All your games are played and the clock keeps turning  
We're out of tricks with the silence cutting  
And the dagger stick as the doors keep shutting  
  
I just wanna be part of the fire  
Of the fire, of the fire, of the fire, of the fire in your eyes  
I just wanna be part of the fire  
Of the fire, of the fire, of the fire, of the fire in your eyes  
Always, always, always, always (forever)  
Always (forever), always (forever)  
Always (forever), always

In the summer's sky  
Then came the rain  
And once again  
A tear fell  
From her mother's eye

"
860,Depeche Mode,Blue Dress,"Put it on  
And don't say a word  
Put it on  
The one that I prefer  
Put it on  
And stand before my eyes  
Put it on  
Please don't question why  
Can you believe  
Something so simple  
Something so trivial  
Makes me a happy man  
Can't you understand  
Say you believe  
Just how easy  
It is to please me  
Because when you learn  
You'll know what makes the world turn  
Put it on  
I can feel so much  
Put it on  
I don't need to touch  
Put it on  
Here before my eyes  
Put it on  
Because you realise  
And you believe  
Something so worthless  
Serves a purpose  
It makes me a happy man  
Can't you understand  
Say you believe  
Just how easy  
It is to please me  
Because when you learn  
You'll know what makes the world turn

861,Depeche Mode,Boys Say Go!,"You don't understand  
This is a demand  
And I think that I have to show you  
Try to look inside  
Take me for a ride  
In the day and the night  
Get to know you  
  
Boys meet boys get together  
Boys meet boys live forever  
Don't say no  
Boys say go  
  
I can run away  
If you never stay  
And the rain and the pain and the sorrow  
I'm not very sure  
When you close the door  
If the end is the same as tomorrow  
  
Boys!  
Boys!  
Boys say go!

"
862,Depeche Mode,Breathe,"I heard a rumor  
They travel far  
You know what it's like  
The way people are  
They talk and they talk  
Though they don't understand  
They'll whisper and whisper  
And lie on demand  
Please tell me now  
I want to know  
I have to hear it from your lips  
Say it's not so  
  
I heard it on Monday  
And I laughed a while  
I heard it on Tuesday  
I managed to smile  
I heard it on Wednesday  
My patience was tried  
I heard it on Thursday  
And I hurt inside  
I want to know  
The depths of your mind  
Tell me this whole thing is madness  
And we're doing fine  
Put your little hand in mine  
And believe in love  
Put your head on my chest  
And breathe love  
Breathe love  
Breathe love  
Breathe love  
  
I heard it from Peter  
Who heard it from Paul  
Who heard it from someone  
I don't know at all  
I heard it from Mary  
Who heard it from Ruth  
Who swore on the Bible  
She's telling the truth  
I heard it from Simon  
Who heard it from James  
Confirming with Sarah  
That I was to blame  
I heard it from Joseph  
Who heard it from John  
Who said with conviction  
That all hope was gone  
So I need to know  
Your alibis  
I need to hear that you love me  
Before you say goodbye  
Before you say goodbye  
Before you say goodbye  
Before you say goodbye

"
863,Depeche Mode,But Not Tonight,"Oh God, it's raining  
But I'm not complaining  
It's filling me up  
With new life  
  
The stars in the sky  
Bring tears to my eyes  
They're lighting my way  
Tonight  
  
And I haven't felt so alive  
In years  
  
Just for a day  
On a day like today  
I'll get away from this  
Constant debauchery  
  
The wind in my hair  
Makes me so aware  
How good it is to live  
Tonight  
  
And I haven't felt so alive  
In years  
  
The moon  
Is shining in the sky  
Reminding me  
Of so many other nights  
But they're not like tonight  
  
Oh God, it's raining  
And I'm not containing  
My pleasure at being  
So wet  
  
Here on my own  
All on my own  
How good it feels to be alone  
Tonight  
  
And I haven't felt so alive  
In years  
  
The moon  
Is shining in the sky  
Reminding me  
Of so many other nights  
When my eyes have been so red  
I've been mistaken for dead  
But not tonight

864,Depeche Mode,Comatose,"Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Of conscious feeling  
  
Take a light  
Start the flame  
Play the game  
I am lost  
In your eyes  
Hypnotized  
Here I believe  
Dreams never deceive  
  
Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Life has no meaning  
  
Bodies move  
Colors change  
Girl, you're strange  
Here inside  
I'm at home  
I'm alive  
  
Don't be afraid  
I'm floating away  
  
Comatose, almost  
You've got me dreaming  
Slipping in  
And sliding out  
Of conscious feeling  
  
Comatose, almost  
Comatose, almost  
Comatose

"
865,Depeche Mode,Come Back,"[Chorus]  
Come back Come back to me  
I've been waiting here patiently  
  
I've been walking a thin white line  
Between love and hate  
I could use a lil' company  
A lil' kindness to go a long way  
  
Weeks turn into months  
Months turn into years  
Reaching the same conclusions  
Gathering up the fear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been walking a thin white line  
Between love and hate  
I could use a lil' company  
A lil' kindness to go a long way

Reaching the same conclusions  
Gathering up the fear

"
866,Depeche Mode,Coming Back To You,"Maybe I'm still hurting  
I can't turn the other cheek  
But you know that I still love you  
It's just that I can't speak  
I looked for you in everyone  
And they called me on that too  
I lived alone but I was only  
Coming back to you  
Ah they're shutting down the factory now  
Just when all the bills are due  
And the fields they're under lock and key  
Though the rain and the sun come through  
And springtime starts but then it stops  
In the name of something new  
And all the senses rise against this  
Coming back to you  
And they're handing down my sentence now  
And I know what I must do  
Another mile of silence while I'm  
Coming back to you  
There are many in your life  
And many still to be  
Since you are a shining light  
There's many that you'll see  
But I have to deal with envy  
When you choose the precious few  
Who've left their pride on the other side of  
Coming back to you  
Even in your arms I know  
I'll never get it right  
Even when you bend  
To give me comfort in the night  
I've got to have your word on this  
Or none of it is true  
And all I've said was just instead of  
Coming back to you

867,Depeche Mode,Compulsion (Evolution Mix),"Charms in limited supply  
And refusing to stretch  
That indefinable nothing  
Somehow keeps pushing you  
Finding the right words  
Can be a problem  
How many times must it be said  
There's no plan  
It had to happen  
Got to move on sometime  
And it's about time  
By putting one foot in front on another  
And repeating the process  
Cross over the street  
You're free to change your mind  
Strength through diversity  
Couldn't have put it more plainly  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Got to move on sometime  
Charms in limited supply  
Under threat of extinction  
That indefinable nothing  
Somehow motivates you

868,Depeche Mode,Corrupt,"I could corrupt you  
In a heart beat  
You think your so special  
Think your so sweet  
What are you trying don't even tempt me  
Soon you'll be crying unwishing you dreamt of be  
You'll be calling out my name  
When you need someone to blame  
  
I can corrupt you  
It would be easy  
Watching you suffer  
God, it would please me  
  
I wanna touch you with my little finger  
I know it will crush you my memory would linger  
You'd be crying out in pain  
Begging me to play my games  
  
I can corrupt you  
It will be ugly  
They could sedate you  
But what good would drugs be  
I wanna touch you with my hands on your hips  
It would be too much to  
Place my lips on your lips  
You'll be calling out my name  
Begging me to play my games

869,Depeche Mode,Dangerous,"The things you do  
Aren't good for my health  
The moves you make  
You make for yourself  
The means you use  
Aren't meant to confuse  
Although they do  
They're the ones that I would choose  
  
And I wouldn't want it any other way  
You wouldn't let me anyway  
  
Dangerous  
The way you leave me wanting more  
Dangerous  
That's what I want you for  
Dangerous  
When I am in your arms  
Dangerous

The lies you tell  
Aren't meant to deceive  
They're not there  
For me to believe  
I've heard  
Your vicious words  
You know by now  
It takes a lot to see me hurt  
  
And I couldn't take it any other way  
But there's a price I have to pay

Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on  
  
As your bony fingers close around me  
Long and spindly  
Death becomes me  
Heaven, can you see what I see?  
  
Hey, you, pale and sickly child  
You're death and living reconciled  
Been walking home a crooked mile  
  
Paying debt to karma  
You party for a living  
What you take won't kill you  
But careful what you're giving  
  
There's no time for hesitating  
Pain is ready, pain is waiting  
Primed to do it's educating  
  
Unwanted, uninvited kin  
It creeps beneath your crawling skin  
It lives without, it lives within you  
  
Feel the fever coming  
You're shaking and twitching  
You can scratch all over  
But that won't stop you itching  
  
Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on  
  
Blame it on your karmic curse  
Oh, shame upon the universe  
It knows its lines  
It's well rehearsed  
  
It sucked you in, it dragged you down  
To where there is no hallowed ground  
Where holiness is never found  
  
Paying debt to karma  
You party for a living  
What you take won't kill you  
But careful what you're giving  
  
Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on

872,Depeche Mode,Dressed In Black,"She's dressed in black again  
And I'm falling down again  
Down to the floor again  
I'm begging for more again  
But oh what can you do  
When she's dressed in black  
  
My mind wanders endlessly  
On paths where she's leading me  
With games that she likes to play  
And words that she doesn't say  
Not when we're alone  
And she's dressed in black  
  
As a picture of herself  
She's a picture of the world  
A reflection of you  
A reflection of me  
And it's all there to see  
If you only give in  
To the fire within  
  
Dressed in black again  
  
Shadows fall onto me  
And she stands there over me  
And waits to encompass me  
I lay here helplessly  
But oh what can you do  
When she's dressed in black  
  
Dressed in black again

873,Depeche Mode,Enjoy The Silence,"Words like violence  
Break the silence  
Come crashing in  
Into my little world  
Painful to me  
Pierce right through me  
Can't you understand  
Oh my little girl  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
They can only do harm  
Vows are spoken  
To be broken  
Feelings are intense  
Words are trivial  
Pleasures remain  
So does the pain  
Words are meaningless  
And forgettable  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
They can only do harm  
Enjoy the silence

874,Depeche Mode,Free,"I will never be free  
I shall never be released

Oh what heartbreak  
Following me  
Calling to me  
  
I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness  
  
See what I've prayed  
Hear what loves sings  
Sad melodies  
Enticing me  
  
I will never be free  
I shall never be released  
From the chains that bind me  
That torture and blind me  
And keep me from peace  
  
I will never be free  
I will never be laid to rest  
Sisters and brothers  
I'll never recover  
From this tenderness

875,Depeche Mode,Get Right With Me,"I will have faith in man  
That is hard to understand  
Show some humility  
You have the ability  
Get right with me  
Friends, if you've lost your way  
You will find it again some day  
Come down from your pedestals  
And open your mouths that's all  
Get right with me  
Life is such a short thing  
That I cannot comprehend  
But if this life were a bought thing  
There are ways I know we'd mend  
People, take my advice  
Already told you once, once or twice  
Don't waste your energy  
Making apologies  
Get right with me

876,Depeche Mode,Get The Balance Right,"There's more besides joyrides  
Little house in the countryside  
Understand, learn to demand,  
Compromise, sometimes lie  
Get the Balance right, get the balance right  
Be responsible, respectable,  
Stable but gullible  
Concerned and caring, help the helpless  
But always remain ultimately selfish  
Get the balance right, get the balance right  
You think you've got a hold of it all  
You haven't got a hold at all  
When you reach the top, get ready to drop  
Prepare yourself for the fall, you're gonna fall  
It's almost predictable  
Don't take this way, don't take that way  
Straight down the middle until next Thursday  
Push to the left, back to the right  
Twist and turn 'til you've got it right  
Get the balance right

Calling your name  
My memory lingers  
You'll never be the same  
I'm the hole in your heart  
I'm the stain in your bed  
The phantom in your fingers  
The voices in your head  
  
One touch is all it took  
To draw you in  
To leave you hooked  
One kiss, you paid the price  
You had a taste  
Of paradise  
  
Now you're running in circles  
Chasing imaginary footsteps  
Reaching for shadows  
In the bed where I once slept  
  
I'm the ghost in your house  
Calling your name  
My memory lingers  
You'll never be the same  
I'm the hole in your heart  
I'm the stain in your bed  
The phantom in your fingers  
The voices in your head  
  
One thought is all it takes  
You lose control  
You make mistakes  
This pain will never leave  
Until I die  
You'll always grieve  
  
Now you're falling to pieces  
Seeing my face wherever you go  
Talking to strangers  
From a place they'll never know

In you  
  
There is no denying  
How I have been changed  
You won't hear me crying  
Now misery is strange  
  
I can dream  
I can fly  
Now it seems I get by  
With you  
  
Goodbye, yeah  
Goodbye, again  
  
I was always looking  
Looking for someone  
Someone to stick my hook in  
And pull it out and run  
  
Now I'm caught on your line  
All my thoughts are entwined  
In you  
  
Goodbye, yeah  
Goodbye, again

Through the golden gates

Stop and hesitate

With my fate in the air  
For you

The best for me

Like shackles on your feet  
Like a halo in reverse

And in your head it's worse  
  
There's a pain  
A famine in your heart  
An aching to be free  
Can't you see  
All love's luxuries  
Are here for you and me  
  
And when our worlds they fall apart  
When the walls come tumbling in  
Though we may deserve it  
It will be worth it  
  
Bring your chains  
Your lips of tragedy  
And fall into my arms

When the walls come tumbling in  
Though we may deserve it  
It will be worth it

Only to return  
Life goes by so fast  
  
So who is left to play  
Nothing's quite the same  
We can't live in the past  
  
I'm burning inside as the sun  
And I only just begun  
Love it fades so fast  
  
Sometimes I forget all I will regret  
When I leave this world behind  
And sometimes I'm not sure  
What I'm fighting for  
It happens all the time  
  
I know I've had enough, maybe far too much  
It's easy to be kind  
And when it's just me and you  
I know what I have to do  
I know I can leave this world behind  
  
No need to feel ashamed  
When there's nothing to be gained  
When your dreams are in the past  
Like stars we crush and burn  
Only to return  
These lines are change so fast  
  
Sometimes I forget all I will regret  
When I leave this world behind  
And sometimes I'm not sure  
What I'm fighting for  
It happens all the time  
It happens all the time  
It happens all the time

Silently  
I slowly lose myself  
Over and over

Endlessly  
Surrender to my will  
Forever and ever  
  
I dissolve in trust  
I will sing with joy  
I will end up dust  
I'm in heaven  
  
I stand in golden rays  
Radiantly  
I burn a fire of love  
Over and over  
  
Reflecting endless light  
Relentlessly  
I have embraced the flame  
Forever and ever  
  
I will scream the word  
Jump into the void  
I will guide the world  
Up to heaven

We share something

What you get is another hole to feed  
  
Your name was the one that was always chosen  
Your words and the kindness that set me free  
Words can leave you broken inside

I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here, we can love  
We share something

The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen  
You open my eyes to the world I could believe  
  
This world has left me broken inside  
I'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
Words can leave you broken inside  
You'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here  
  
This world can leave you broken inside  
I'll have to decide  
I'm hanging onto my pride  
  
We are here, we can love  
We share something  
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me  
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen  
You open my eyes to the world I could believe

"
886,Depeche Mode,I Am You,"You have bound my heart with subtle chains  
So much pleasure that it feels like pain  
So entwined now that we can't shake free  
I am you, and you are me  
  
No escaping from the mess we're in  
So much pleasure that it must be sin  
I must live with this reality  
I am yours eternally  
  
There's no turning back  
We're in this trap  
No denying the facts  
No, no, no  
No excuses to give  
I'm the one you're with  
We've no alternative  
No, no, no  
  
Dark obsession in the name of love  
This addiction that we're both part of  
Leads us deeper into mystery  
Keeps us craving endlessly  
  
Strange compulsions that I can't control  
Pure possession of my heart and soul  
I must live with this reality  
  
I am you, and you are me  
I am you, and you are me  
I am you, and you are me  
I am you, and you are me  
  
There's no turning back  
We're in this trap  
No denying the facts  
No, no, no  
No excuses to give  
I'm the one you're with  
We've no alternative  
No, no, no

887,Depeche Mode,I Feel Loved,"It's the dark night of my soul  
And temptation's taking hold  
But through the pain and the suffering  
Through the heartache and trembling  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel loved  
I feel loved  
  
As the darkness closes in  
In my head I hear whispering  
Questioning and beckoning  
But I'm not taken in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the depths of my emptiness  
Comes a feeling of inner bliss  
I feel wanted, I feel desired  
I can feel my soul on fire  
  
[Chorus]

888,Depeche Mode,I Want You Now,"I want you now  
Tomorrow won't do  
There's a yearning inside  
And it's showing through  
Reach out your hands  
And accept my love  
We've waited for too long  
Enough is enough  
I want you now  
  
My heart is aching  
My body is burning  
My hands are shaking  
My head is turning  
You understand  
It's so easy to choose  
We've got time to kill  
We've got nothing to lose  
I want you now  
  
And I don't mean to sound  
Like one of the boys  
That's now what I'm trying to do  
I don't want to be  
Like one of the boys  
I just want you now  
  
Because I've got a love  
A love that won't wait  
A love that is growing  
And it's getting late  
Do you know what it means  
To be left this way  
When everyone's gone  
And the feelings they stay  
I want you now

"
889,Depeche Mode,Ice Machine,"Ice Machine  
Running through my head secretly  
The shout of the boys in the factory  
I'll ring you on the telephone silently  
Like blood, like wine in the darkroom scene  
Darkroom scene  
  
A letter once composed  
Seven years long  
And as tall as a tree  
Written on the wall efficient  
Efficiency  
  
Resurrect, as a feeling, on my window,  
Of a past reunion  
Resurrect as a feeling on my window  
Of a past reunion  
Mission of a picture like the city and the air we breathe  
The air we breathe  
Air we breathe  
  
She stood beside me once again  
I knew her face  
We met before in the street  
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet  
Their dancing feet  
Dancing feet

"
890,Depeche Mode,In A Manner Of Speaking (Trandy Mix),"In a manner of speaking  
I just want to say  
That I could never forget the way  
You told me everything  
By saying nothing  
In a manner of speaking  
I don't understand  
How love in silence becomes reprimand  
But the way I feel about you  
Is beyond words  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me everything  
In a manner of speaking  
Semantics won't do  
In this life that we live  
We only make do  
And the way that we feel  
Might have to be sacrificed  
So in a manner of speaking  
I just want to say  
That like you I should find a way  
To tell you everything  
By saying nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words

891,Depeche Mode,In Chains,"The way you move  
Has got me yearning  
The way you move  
Has left me burning  
I know you know what you're doing to me  
I know my hands will never be free  
I know what it's like to be  
In chains  
  
The way you move  
Is meant to haunt me  
The way you move  
To tempt and taunt me  
I know you knew on the day you were born  
I know somehow I should've been warned  
I know I walk every midnight to dawn  
In Chains  
  
In chains, I'm in chains  
In chains, I'm in chains  
  
You've got me dying for you  
Its you that I'm living through  
You've got me praying to you  
Saying to you anything you want me to  
You've got me reaching for you  
My souls beseeching me too  
You've got me singing to you  
Bringing to you anything you ask me to  
  
The way you move  
Is mesmerizing  
The way you move  
Is hypnotizing  
I know I crumble when you are around  
Start to mumble a bit of a false sound  
Straggle, stumble, shackled and bound  
In chains  
  
In chains, I'm in chains  
In chains, I'm in chains  
  
You've got me dying for you  
Its you that I'm living through  
You've got me praying to you  
Saying to you anything you want me to  
You've got me reaching for you  
My souls beseeching me too

"
892,Depeche Mode,In Your Memory,"Put up the barriers  
Shut down your senses  
Cover up with all of your pretenses  
See no evil  
Your eyes are blunted  
We are the hunters  
We are the hunted  
  
Place it in your memory  
Leave it in your past  
But don't forget  
  
Taking a tumble  
I'm taking a dive  
Sometimes I stumble when my mind's made up  
Reaction levels  
Seem strangely muted  
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted  
  
Place it in your memory  
Leave it in your past  
But don't forget

893,Depeche Mode,In Your Room,"In your room  
Where time stands still  
Or moves at your will  
Will you let the morning come soon  
Or will you leave me lying here  
In your favourite darkness  
Your favourite half-light  
Your favourite consciousness  
Your favourite slave  
In your room  
Where souls disappear  
Only you exist here  
Will you lead me to your armchair  
Or leave me lying here  
Your favourite innocence  
Your favourite prize  
Your favourite smile  
Your favourite slave  
I'm hanging on your words  
Living on your breath  
Feeling with your skin  
Will I always be here  
In your room  
Your burning eyes  
Cause flames to arise  
Will you let the fire die down soon  
Or will I always be here  
Your favourite passion  
Your favourite game  
Your favourite mirror  
Your favourite slave  
I'm hanging on your words  
Living on your breath  
Feeling with your skin  
Will I always be here

894,Depeche Mode,It Doesn't Matter Two,"As I lay here with you  
The shame lies with us  
We talk of love and trust  
That doesn't matter  
  
Though we may be the last in the world  
We feel like pioneers  
Telling hopes and fears  
To one another  
  
And oh what a feeling  
Inside of me  
It might last for an hour  
Wounds aren't healing  
Inside of me  
Though it feel good now  
I know it's only for now  
  
The feeling is intense  
You grip me with your eyes  
And then I realize  
It doesn't matter

"
895,Depeche Mode,It's No Good,"I'm going to take my time  
I have all the time in the world  
To make you mine  
It is written in the stars above  
The gods decree  
You'll be right here by my side  
Right next to me  
You can run but you cannot hide  
Don't say you want me  
Don't say you need me  
Don't say you love me  
It's understood  
Don't say you're happy  
Out there without me  
I know you can't be  
'Cause it's no good  
I'll be fine  
I'll be waiting patiently  
Till you see the signs  
And come running to my open arms  
When will you realize  
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide  
Open up your eyes  
You can't turn back the tide  
Don't say you want me  
Don't say you need me  
Don't say you love me  
It's understood  
Don't say you're happy  
Out there without me  
I know you can't be  
'Cause it's no good  
I'm going to take my time  
I have all the time in the world  
To make you mine

"
896,Depeche Mode,Judas,"Is simplicity best  
Or simply the easiest  
The narrowest path  
Is always the holiest  
So walk on barefoot for me  
Suffer some misery  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
Man will survive  
The harshest conditions  
And stay alive  
Through difficult decisions  
So make up your mind for me  
Walk the line for me  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
Idle talk  
And hollow promises  
Cheating Judases  
Doubting Thomases  
Don't just stand there and shout it  
Do something about it  
You can fulfill  
Your wildest ambitions  
And I'm sure you will  
Lose your inhibitions  
So open yourself for me  
Risk your health for me  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
If you want my love  
If you want my love

897,Depeche Mode,Just Can't Get Enough,"When I'm with you baby  
I go out of my head  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
All the things you do to me  
And everything you said  
I just can't get enough  
I just can't get enough  
  
We slip and slide as we fall in love  
And I just can't seem to get enough of  
  
We walk together  
We're walking down the street  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
Every time I think of you  
I know we have to meet  
And I just can't get enough  
I just can't get enough  
  
It's getting hotter  
It's a burning love  
And I just can't seem to get enough of  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I just can't seem to get enough  
  
And when it rains  
You're shining down for me  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
Just like a rainbow  
You know you set me free  
And I just can't get enough  
And I just can't get enough  
  
You're like an angel  
And you give me your love  
And I just can't seem to get enough of

I just can't get enough

"
898,Depeche Mode,Leave In Silence,"I've told myself so many times before  
But this time I think I mean it for sure  
We have reached a full stop  
Nothing's gonna save us from the big drop  
Reached our natural conclusion  
Outlived the illusion  
I hate being in these situations  
That call for diplomatic relations  
If I only knew the answer  
Or I thought we had a chance  
Or I could stop this  
I would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer  
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore  
What can I say? I'm heading for the door  
I can't stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence  
We've been running around in circles all year  
Doing this and that and getting nowhere  
This'll be the last time  
(I think I said that last time)  
If I only had a potion,  
Some magical lotion  
That could stop this, I would stop this  
I would set the wheels in motion  
What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore  
What can I say? I'm heading for the door  
I can't stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence  

"
899,Depeche Mode,Lie To Me,"[Chorus: x2]  
Come on and lay with me  
Come on and lie to me  
Tell me you love me  
Say I'm the only one  
  
Experiences have a lasting impression  
But words once spoken  
Don't mean a lot now  
Belief is the way  
The way of the innocent  
And when I say innocent  
I should say naive  
So lie to me  
But do it with sincerity  
Make me listen  
Just for a minute  
Make me think  
There's some truth in it  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Promises made for convenience  
Aren't necessarily  
What we need  
Truth is a word  
That's lost its meaning  
The truth has become  
Merely half-truth  
So lie to me  
Like they do it in the factory  
Make me think  
That at the end of the day  
Some great reward  
Will be coming my way  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

900,Depeche Mode,Light,"Take my hand  
And walk in the light  
Understand, there's a fire to ignite  
You know we have a responsibility  
It's true we've been chosen  
And now we have the possibility  
Of melting what's frozen  
  
Walk with me with the rapture inside  
Can't you see it's not our place to decide  
You know we have to make a case for love  
It's more of a duty  
It's clear we have a mission from above  
A mission of beauty  
  
You know I wouldn't lie to you  
What would I achieve by that  
It's more than I would try to do  
These are the facts  
  
Take your place here  
With love in your heart  
Just embrace what you've known from the start  
We are fulfilling our only destiny  
The angels have spoken  
And all the gods in the universe agree  
The spell can't be broken

901,Depeche Mode,Lillian,"Oh, Lillian  
Look what you've done  
You've stripped my heart  
Ripped it apart  
In the name of fun  
  
Oh, Lillian  
I'm a poor man's son  
And precious jewels  
Weren't found in schools  
Where I came from  
  
Pain and misery always hit the spot  
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got  
  
Oh, Lillian  
I should have run  
I should have known  
Each dress you own  
Is a loaded gun  
  
Oh, Lillian  
  
Oh, Lillian  
I need protection  
I hear your voice  
And any choice I had is gone  
  
Oh, Lillian  
Once I begun  
I couldn't stop  
'til every drop of blood was sung  
  
Pain and misery always hit the spot  
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got  
  
Oh, Lillian  
Look what you've done  
You stripped my heart  
Ripped it apart  
In the name of fun  
  
Oh, Lillian

I have no choice  
It will infinitely ring  
  
My little soul  
Will leave a footprint  
  
I'm channeling the universe  
It's focusing its love inside of me  
A Singularity  
  
My little words  
Are going to sting  
Haven't you heard  
The pain and joy they bring  
  
My little soul

903,Depeche Mode,Long Time Lie,"It's been a while since you did something  
Not so long since you complained  
Can sit around here doing nothing everyday  
You're the coward who points the finger  
I understand that I'm helping you  
You have delusions and some spaced-out fantasies  
That's what you do  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
Long time lie  
  
Don't you ever look in the mirror  
Don't you know there's so much more  
Locked up inside that box behind your door  
All your twisted conversations  
When you're sitting all alone  
Just remember we know your secret while you moan  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
Long time lie

That lay before me  
All of the firsts and the definite lasts  
That lay in store for me  
There was a time

Now I find that most of the time  
Love's not enough in itself  
Consequently, I've a tendency to be unhappy  
You see the thoughts in my head  
All the words that were said  
All the blues and the reds get to me  
There was a time  
When all on my mind was love  
Now I find that most of the time  
Love's not enough in itself  
All of these absurdities  
That lay before us  
All of the doubts and the certainties  
That lay in store for us  
There was a time

Now I find that most of the time  
Love's not enough in itself

And I will die in the flames  
As I draw my last breath  
As I'm closing on death  
I will call out your name  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
Nailed up on the cross  
While you're having your fun  
As the damage is done  
I'm assessing the cost  
  
I knew what I was letting myself in for  
I knew that I could never even the score  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
I need to be by your side  
I have knelt at your feet  
I have felt your deceit  
Couldn't leave if I tried  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
Tortured every hour  
From the day I was born  
I've been moved like a pawn  
By the greatest of powers  
  
I knew that I would have to suffer in vain  
Aware that I would never outgrow the pain  
  
I've been a martyr for love  
I've been a martyr for love  
I've been a martyr for love

907,Depeche Mode,Master And Servant,"There's a new game  
We like to play you see  
A game with added reality  
You treat me like a dog  
Get me down on my knees  
We call it master and servant  
We call it master and servant  
It's a lot like life  
This play between the sheets  
With you on top and me underneath  
Forget all about equality  
Let's play master and servant  
Let's play master and servant  
It's a lot like life  
And that's what's appealing  
If you despise that throwaway feeling  
From disposable fun  
Then this is the one  
Domination's the name of the game  
In bed or in life  
They're both just the same  
Except in one you're fulfilled  
At the end of the day  
Let's play master and servant  
Let's play master and servant  
Let's play master and servant  
Come on, master and servant

908,Depeche Mode,Mercy In You,"You know what I need  
When my heart bleeds  
I suffer from greed  
A longing to feed  
On the mercy in you  
I can't conceal  
The way I'm healed  
The pleasure I feel  
When I have to deal  
With the mercy in you  
I would do it all again  
Lose my way and fall again  
Just so I could call again  
On the mercy in you  
When here in my mind  
I feel inclined  
To wrongly treat you unkind  
I have faith I will find  
The mercy in you  
I would lose my way again  
Be led hopelessly astray again  
Just so I could pray again  
For the mercy in you  
When here in my mind  
I have been blind  
Emotionally behind  
I have faith I will find  
The mercy in you

909,Depeche Mode,Monument,"When the site was found  
We laid the foundations down  
It didn't take long before  
They came back tumbling down  
Don't build at night  
You need a little light  
How else are you going to see  
What it is going to be like  
  
So we picked up our tools  
And we worked in the morning light  
With the last stone placed  
Wasn't it a wonderful site  
But it fell back down  
And scattered all around  
Anything passes  
When you need glasses  
  
My monument  
It feel down  
My monument  
It feel down  
  
Work all of my days for this kind of praise  
It fell down  
Work all of my days  
It fell down

It all seems so absurd  
That this should have occurred  
My very only secret  
And I had to go and leak it!  
My secret garden's not so secret anymore!  
  
No, my secret garden's not so secret anymore!  
Run through the fields, down to the edge of the water  
Can't stay long, here comes the reason why,  
She'll catch me if she can,  
Take me by the hand  
I'll have to keep on running  
And I just can't see the fun in  
My secret garden not being secret anymore!  
  
It used to be so easy  
On days such as these she'd  
Search and search for hours  
In among the flowers  
I loved it!, I loved her!  
Play the fool, act so cruel, I loved it!  
Read her book, take a look, I loved her!  
  
It all seems so absurd  
That this should have occurred  
My very only secret  
And I had to go and leak it!  
My secret garden's not so secret anymore!

We're watching the world pass us by  
Never want to come down  
Never want to put my feet back down  
On the ground  
I'm taking a ride  
With my best friend  
I hope he never lets me down again  
Promises me I'm as safe as houses  
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers  
I hope he never lets me down again  
Never let me down  
See the stars they're shining bright  
Everything's alright tonight

913,Depeche Mode,New Life,"I stand still stepping on the shady streets  
And I watched that man to a stranger  
You think you only know me when you turn on the light  
Now the room is lit, red danger  
  
Complicating, circulating  
New life, new life  
Operating, generating  
New life, new life  
  
Transitions to another place  
So the time will pass more slowly  
Features fuse and your shadow's red  
Like a film I've seen now show me  
  
Your face is hidden and were out of sight  
And the road just leads to nowhere  
The stranger in the door is the same as before  
So the question answers nowhere  
  
I stand still stepping on the shady streets  
And I watched that man to a stranger  
You think you only know me when you turn on the light  
Now the room is lit, red danger

It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself  
Something beautiful is happening inside for me  
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery  
I feel hypnotized, I feel paralyzed  
I have found heaven

Why I shouldn't spend my time with you

That I find myself  
I find myself  
It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself

There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here  
I feel satisfied  
I belong inside  
Your velvet heaven  
Did I need to sell my soul  
For pleasure like this  
Did I have to lose control  
To treasure your kiss  
Did I need to place my heart  
In the palm of your hand  
Before I could even start  
To understand  
It's only when I lose myself in someone else  
That I find myself  
I find myself

That I find myself

With all the shadows that it cast

Giving all the positive virtues that I possess

919,Depeche Mode,Perfect,"On another world by another star at another place and time  
In another state of consciousness in another state of mind  
Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place,  
That you may reach a different verdict,  
If all the judges missed the case  
  
In a parallel universe that's happening right now  
Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how  
  
And everything could have been perfect  
Everything in the right place  
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect  
Accused, abandoned and disgraced  
  
I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger  
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer  
I heard the sound, i turned my head around  
To watch our love shot down  
  
In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side  
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide  
  
And everything is almost perfect  
Everything is almost right  
There are never any conflicts  
There are never any fights

The program of today  
Lights on, switch on

And the tape is your voice  
Follow all along you  
Till you recognize the choice  
  
I take pictures  
Photographic pictures  
  
Bright light  
Dark room  
Bright light  
Dark room  
  
I said I'd write a letter  
But I never got the time  
And I'm looking to the day  
I mesmerize the light  
  
The years I spend just thinking  
Of a moment we both knew  
A second boss looking into  
It seems it can't be true

Construction time again  
What is it this time  
We're laying a pipeline  
  
Let the beads of sweat flow  
Until the ends have met through  
Could take a long time  
Working on the pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy  
  
On this golden day  
Work's been sent our way  
That could last a lifetime  
Working on the pipeline  
  
From the heart of our land  
To the mouth of the man  
Must reach him sometime  
We're laying a pipeline  
  
Taking from the greedy  
Giving to the needy

Should have hidden it, shouldn't you  
Now you're not satisfied  
With what you're being put through  
  
It's just time to pay the price  
For not listening to advice  
And deciding in your youth  
On the policy of truth  
  
Things could be so different now  
It used to be so civilised  
You will always wonder how  
It could have been if you'd only lied  
  
It's too late to change events  
It's time to face the consequence  
For delivering the proof  
In the policy of truth  
  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
  
Now you're standing there tongue tied  
You'd better learn your lesson well  
Hide what you have to hide  
And tell what you have to tell  
You'll see your problems multiplied  
If you continually decide  
To faithfully pursue  
The policy of truth  
  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before

Need special handling  
My God what have we done to You?  
  
We always try to share  
The tenderest of care  
Now look what we have put You through  
  
[Chorus]  
Things get damaged  
Things get broken  
I thought we'd manage  
But words left unspoken  
Left us so brittle  
There was so little left to give  
  
Angels with silver wings  
Shouldn't know suffering  
I wish I could take the pain for you  
  
If God has a master plan  
That only He understands  
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pray you learn to trust  
Have faith in both of us  
And keep room in your heart for two

I don't think you understand  
What I'm trying to say

I'm in control  
  
Watch your action  
Close reaction  
And everything you're thinking babe inside your head  
Conversation, my creation  
Nothing that you do

Of the things you say

And torture for me  
When I'm misunderstood  
Try as hard as you can, I've tried as hard as I could  
To make you see  
How important it is for me

From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease

In situations like these  
Understand me

Permanently together  
Lovers devoted to  
Each other forever  
Now I've got things to do  
And I've said before that I know you have too  
When I'm not there  
In spirit I'll be there  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease

In situations like these  
Understand me

926,Depeche Mode,Shame,"Do you ever get that feeling  
When the guilt begins to hurt  
Seeing all the children  
Wallowing in dirt  
Crying out with hunger  
Crying out in pain  
At least the dirt will wash off  
When it starts to rain  
  
Soap won't wash away your shame  
  
Do you ever get that feeling  
That something isn't right  
Seeing your brother's fists  
Clenched ready for the fight  
Soon the fighting turns to weapons  
And the weapons turn to wounds  
So the doctors stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch  
  
Surgery won't improve your pain  
  
It all seems so stupid  
It makes me want to give up  
But why should I give up  
When it all seems so stupid  
  
Do you ever get the feeling  
That something can be done  
To eradicate these problems  
And make the people one  
Do you ever get that feeling  
Something like a nagging itch  
And all the while the doctors  
Stitch and stitch and stitch  
And stitch and stitch  
  
Hope alone won't remove the stains  
Shame

927,Depeche Mode,Should Be Higher,"I dream of a day  
When I dare to believe  
You're the answer  
  
When the shame  
And the guilt are removed  
And the truth appears  
  
Of the touch of your hand  
I lose who I am  
If I want to  
  
I try to resist but  
Succumb to the bliss  
Of your kiss  
  
You should be higher  
I'll take you higher  
Well don't be afraid  
You'll just have to pray  
  
Your lies are more attractive  
Than the truth  
Love is all I want  
Your lies are written down now  
In your book  
Love is all I want  
  
Your arms are infected  
They're holding the truth  
Oh stop all your crying  
This one you'll lose  
  
You should be higher  
I'll take you higher  
So don't be afraid  
You'll just have to pray  
  
Your lies are more attractive  
Than the truth  
Love is all I want  
Your lies are written down now  
In your book  
Love is all I want  
  
You should be higher  
You should be higher  
  
Love, love  
Love, love

928,Depeche Mode,Shouldn't Have Done That,"Plans made in the nursery  
Can change the course of history  
Remember that  
  
Mummy's annoyed, says go and play  
Don't show your face  
Stay away all day  
Shouldn't have done that  
  
A small boy and his infantry  
Marching around so naturally  
Shouldn't have done that  
  
Grows up and goes to school  
Such a nice boy  
Obeys all the rules  
Mummy's proud of that  
  
Leaves school to follow his ambition  
Knows what he wants  
To be a politician  
Shouldn't have done that!

And I think that she knew her lines  
  
Break away tonight  
I want to hold your hand  
We've got to get it right  
We've got to understand  
  
Carefully watching waiting as I  
Stood upon the back streets and we start to play  
I was screaming louder as the  
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way  
  
Staring in the night  
A picture in my room  
And I think that she knew her lines  
  
Break away tonight  
I want to hold your hand  
We've got to get it right  
We've got to understand  
  
Placing all the questions in the  
Minutes of a game we won so long ago  
Dangerous and beautiful the  
Radio transmission that I have to know  
  
You could never run  
You could never stay  
And I think you belong to me  
  
Break away tonight

That's how my love goes

Will you take the pain  
I will give to you  
Again and again  
And will you return it  
  
There'll be days  
When I stray  
I may appear to be  
Constantly out of reach  
I give in to sin  
Because I like to practice what I preach  
I'm not trying to say  
I'll have it all my way  
I'm always willing to learn  
When you've got something to teach  
And I'll make it all worthwhile  
I'll make your heart smile  
  
Pain will you return it  
I'll say it again, pain  
Pain will you return it  
I won't say it again

Again and again  
I give in  
Will you give it to be  
I give in  
I'll say it again  
I give in

932,Depeche Mode,The Child Inside,"There is darkness and death in your eyes  
What have you got buried inside?  
The shallow grave in your soul  
The ghosts that have taken control  
  
You really should have dug a little deeper there  
Body parts are starting to appear and scare  
The child inside away  
  
Each tear that flows down your face  
Trickles then picks up the pace  
And turns to a river inside  
A river that will not subside  
  
I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound  
And watching from afar I see a child is drowned  
The child inside your heart  
  
I can see you drifting away  
Heading for the light  
I can see you drifting away  
Every night  
  
Why were you always inside?  
On days when the weather was fine  
And while we were running around  
You were nowhere to be found  
  
You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed  
Well you were made to play games with your soul instead  
The child inside you died

Caught in the spider's web you've spun  
  
Oh you blind one  
Gentle and kind one  
Seeing the world as a loaded gun

Stay as you are the Darkest Star

934,Depeche Mode,The Dead Of Night,"We're the horniest boys  
With the corniest ploys  
Who take the easiest girls  
To our sleaziest worlds  
  
With our lecherous plans  
In our treacherous hands  
You'd be wasting your time  
Saying no, it's a crime  
  
All that we live for you'll regret  
All you remember we'll forget  
  
We are the dead of night  
We're in the zombie room

We are the dead of night  
We're in the zombie room  
Heavenly oversights  
Eating from silver spoons  
  
With our decadent minds  
And our innocent lines  
You'll be playing our games  
With your bodies in flames  
  
When delirious fun  
Has seriously begun  
You'll be down on your knees  
You'll be begging us please  
  
All we're demanding you'll supply  
All we're accused of we'll deny

935,Depeche Mode,The Meaning Of Love,"I've read more than a hundred books  
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times  
But despite all the places I've looked  
It's still no clearer  
I'm still no nearer  
The meaning of love  
  
Noted down all my observations  
Spent an evening watching television  
Still I couldn't say with precision  
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above  
But what's the meaning  
The meaning of love  
(tell me)  
  
From the notes that I've made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
I'm just not sure you see  
I've never been in love before  
  
Next I asked several friends of mine  
If they could spare a few minutes of their time  
Their looks suggested that I've lost my mind  
Tell me the answer  
My Lord high above  
Tell me the meaning  
The meaning of love  
  
From the notes that I've made so far  
Love seems something like wanting a scar  
Well I could be wrong  
I'm just not sure you see  
I've never been in love before  
  
The meaning of love  
(tell me)  
Tell me the meaning of love  
(tell me)

936,Depeche Mode,The Price Of Love,"Wine is sweet and gin is bitter  
Drink all you can but you won't forget her  
You talk too much, you laugh too loud  
You see her face in every crowd  
  
That's the price of love, the price of love  
A debt you pay with tears and pain  
The price of love, the price of love  
It costs you more when you're to blame  
  
Kiss one girl, kiss another  
Kiss them all but you won't recover  
You're dancing slow, you're dancing fast  
You're happy now, but that won't last  
  
That's the price of love, the price of love  
A debt you pay with tears and pain  
The price of love, the price of love  
It costs you more when you're to blame

"
937,Depeche Mode,The Sun And The Moon And The Stars,"One subtle look  
God help me  
Is all it took  
To sell me  
One single word  
Unspoken  
Your name unheard  
And I'm broken  
  
The sun and the moon  
And the stars in the sky  
Are laughing  
They've seen it all before  
For the wind in the trees  
And the waves on the seas  
It's the same thing  
They can't take any more  
  
One gentle touch  
And I'm helpless  
It's all too much  
For my senses  
One simple prayer  
Denied me  
When you're not there  
Beside me  
  
The sun and the moon  
And the stars in the sky  
Are laughing  
They've seen it all before  
For the wind in the trees  
And the waves on the seas  
It's the same thing  
They can't take any more

For all of the fun  
The damage is done  
And I feel diseased  
I'm down on my knees  
And I need forgiveness  
Someone to bear witness  
To the goodness within  
Beneath the sin  
Although I may flirt  
With all kinds of dirt  
To the point of disease  
Now I want release  
From all this decay  
Take it away  
And somewhere  
There's someone who cares  
With a heart of gold  
To have and to hold

"
939,Depeche Mode,Told You So,"And do those feet in modern times  
Walk upon the flowers  
And walk upon their brothers  
While their heads are busy lying low  
Trying to keep to cover...oh  
  
Something went wrong  
Along the way  
Everybody's waiting for  
Judgment day  
  
So they can go  
Told you so  
  
Bring me my gun of itching desire  
Bring me my bullets and I will fire  
Sights set higher than the tall church spire  
  
Standing in line  
The blind lead the blind  
Waiting and waiting  
For an overdue sign  
Brothers and sisters  
Playing Chinese whispers  
If things aren't suited  
Then they'll get diluted  
  
There's one more dead with a hole in his head  
He shouldn't have said all the things he said  
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled

"
940,Depeche Mode,Tomorrow's Dance,"Saturday night, you look so chic  
Been waiting for this moment, been waiting all week  
The pub is crowded, much too hot  
The boys, they're dancing, they just can't stop  
  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance your dance, you dance your chance  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride  
  
Ice cold drinks, get sold tonight  
We're gonna get happy, the occasion is right  
You start to move, you take the floor  
The music is better than ever before  
  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance your dance, you dance your chance  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride  
  
3 am, I just can't last  
The music is loud and much too fast  
You cannot get out, you wanna stay  
You gotta hang out, another dancing day  
  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance your dance, you dance your chance  
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance  
You dance with pride and you dance with pride

"
941,Depeche Mode,Tora! Tora! Tora!,"They were raining from the sky  
Exploding in my heart  
Is this a love in disguise  
Or just a form of modern art  
  
From the skies you could almost hear them cry  
Tora Tora Tora  
In the town they were going down  
Tora Tora Tora  
  
I had a nightmare only yesterday  
You played a skeleton  
You took my love then died that day  
I played an American  
  
From the skies you can almost hear them cry  
Tora! Tora! Tora!  
In the town they were going down  
Tora! Tora! Tora!  
  
I played an American

942,Depeche Mode,Useless [The Kruder And Dorfmeister Session],"Echoing, echoing in my mind  
  
Well, it's about time  
It's beginning to hurt  
Time you made up your mind  
Just what is it all worth  
  
Watch the clock on the wall  
Feel the slowing of time  
Hear a voice in the hall  
Echoing in my mind  
  
Here I stand the accused  
With your fist in my face  
Feeling tired and bruised  
With the bitterest taste

943,Depeche Mode,Waiting For The Night,"I'm waiting for the night to fall  
I know that it will save us all  
When everything's dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
I'm waiting for the night to fall  
When everything is bearable  
And there in the still  
All that you feel is tranquillity  
There is a star in the sky  
Guiding my way with its light  
And in the glow of the moon  
Know my deliverance will come soon  
I'm waiting for the night to fall  
I know that it will save us all  
When everything's dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
I'm waiting for the night to fall  
When everything is bearable  
And there in the still  
All that you feel is tranquillity  
There is a sound in the calm  
Someone is coming to harm  
I press my hands to my ears  
It's easier here just to forget fear  
And when I squinted  
The world seemed rose-tinted  
And angels appeared to descend  
To my surprise  
With half-closed eyes  
Things looked even better  
Than when they were open  
Been waiting for the night to fall  
I knew that it would save us all  
Now everything's dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
Been waiting for the night to fall  
Now everything is bearable  
And here in the still  
All that you feel is tranquility

944,Depeche Mode,Walking In My Shoes,"I would tell you about the things  
They put me through  
The pain I've been subjected to  
But the Lord himself would blush  
The countless feasts laid at my feet  
Forbidden fruits for me to eat  
But I think your pulse would start to rush  
  
Now I'm not looking for absolution  
Forgiveness for the things I do  
But before you come to any conclusions  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
You'll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes  
  
Morality would frown upon  
Decency look down upon  
The scapegoat fate's made of me  
But I promise now, my judge and jurors  
My intentions couldn't have been purer  
My case is easy to see  
  
I'm not looking for a clearer conscience  
Peace of mind after what I've been through  
And before we talk of any repentance  
Try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
You'll stumble in my footsteps  
Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes  
If you try walking in my shoes  
Try walking in my shoes  
  
Now I'm not looking for absolution  
Forgiveness for the things I do  
But before you come to any conclusions

Keep the same appointments I kept  
If you try walking in my shoes

945,Depeche Mode,Welcome To My World,"Welcome to my world  
Step right through the door  
Leave your tranquilizers at home  
You don't need them anymore  
  
All the drama queens have gone  
And the devil got dismayed  
He backed up and fled this town  
His master plan delayed  
  
And if you stay a while  
I'll penetrate your soul  
I'll bleed into your dreams  
You'll want to lose control  
I'll weep into your eyes  
I'll make your vision sing  
I'll open endless skies  
And ride your broken wings  
  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
  
Watch the sunrise set  
And the moon begin to blush  
Our naked innocence  
Translucently too much  
  
And I hold you in my arms  
I keep you by my side  
And we sleep the devil's sleep  
Just to keep him satisfied  
  
And if you stay a while  
I'll penetrate your soul  
I'll bleed into your dreams  
You'll want to lose control  
I'll weep into your eyes  
I'll make your vision sing  
I'll open endless skies  
And ride your broken wings  
  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world  
Welcome to my world

946,Depeche Mode,Wrong,"I was born with the wrong sign  
In the wrong house  
With the wrong ascendancy  
I took the wrong road  
That led to the wrong tendencies

For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme  
On the wrong day of the wrong week  
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
There's something wrong with me chemically  
Something wrong with me inherently  
The wrong mix in the wrong genes  
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means  
It was the wrong plan  
In the wrong hands  
With the wrong theory for the wrong man  
The wrong lies, on the wrong vibes  
The wrong questions with the wrong replies  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
I was marching to the wrong drum  
With the wrong scum  
Pissing out the wrong energy  
Using all the wrong lines  
And the wrong signs  
With the wrong intensity  
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book  
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook  
Made the wrong move, every wrong night  
With the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong

947,Elvis Costello,Baby's Got A Brand New Hairdo,"Baby's got a brand new hairdo, but doesn't she look so nice?  
She said everything that she cares to, she's saying it not once but twice  
She said it doesn't matter unless I say it matters  
Well, I don't care about all that modern jazz  
The girl that used to have it, and the girl I still have  
She's the girl that used to have it and the girl I still have  
Baby's got a brand new hairdo, and doesn't she look so fine?  
She said everything that she used to  
Except she's picking your heart, not mine  
She said ""it doesn't matter unless I say it matters""  
[?]  
I don't care about all that modern jazz  
The girl that used to have it, and girl I still have  
She's the girl that used to have it, and the girl I still have  
Baby's got a brand new hairdo, and doesn't she look so good?  
She looks like Billy Boy Arnold, said I wish you would  
I wish you would  
Baby's got a brand new hairdo, I wonder what's left inside  
She used to [?] at med school, before she learned how to be snide  
She walks in the place and everybody scatters  
I don't care about all the modern girls  
She's the girl that I used to have and the girl I still have  
She the, she the...

"
948,Elvis Costello,Basement Kiss,"Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road  
For in Belgravia  
Rumors have been whispered and suggestions have been made  
Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense?  
You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense  
You say you need the money  
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?  
  
Who's that sneaking 'round the door?  
You can't come here no more  
Can't you go home again?  
She used to sit alone for hours  
Spend her evenings watering dried flowers  
  
When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed  
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head  
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead  
  
Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat  
It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that  
She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes  
Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom  
And her ugly sister's tranquillizers  
  
Why were you so tardy putting up your guard?  
When you hurt so easily and you try so hard  
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms  
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide?  
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss  
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?

"
949,Elvis Costello,Battered Old Bird,"The landlady's husband came up to town today  
Since he left them both ten years ago to serve the ministry  
The dark down road of his approach in constant rain was drenched  
The tenant's boy said ""How d'ya do"" then swore in French  
Did you teach this little child these curses on my soul  
You should both be shut down in the coal-hole  
That's the way to treat a child who cries out in the night  
And a woman who teaches wrong from right  
  
[Chorus:]  
He's a Battered Old Bird  
And he's living up there  
There's a place where time stands still  
If you keep taking those little pink pills  
  
""Hush your mouth you hypocrite""  
His humour cut her deep  
The tight lipped leer of judgement  
That had seen her love desert her just like sleep  
""Filthy words on children's lips are better, my dear spouse  
Then if I were to speak my mind about this house""  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
On the first floor there are two old maids  
Each one wishing that the other was afraid  
And next door to them is a man so mild  
'Til he chopped off the head of a visitor's child  
He danced upon the bonfire  
Swallowed sleeping pills like dreams  
With a bottle of sweet sherry that everything redeems  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And on the second floor is the Macintosh Man  
He's in his overcoats more than out of them  
And the typewriter's rattling all through the night  
He's burgundy for breakfast tight  
He says ""One day I'll throw away all of my cares  
And it is always Christmas in a cupboard at the top of the stairs""  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
""Well here's a boy if ever there was  
Who's going to do big things  
That's what they all say and that's how the trouble begins  
I've seen them rise and fall  
Been through their big deals and smalls  
He'd better have a dream that goes beyond four walls""  
You think he should be sent outside playing with the traffic  
When pieces of him are already scattered in the attic

"
950,Elvis Costello,Bedlam,"I've got this phosphorescent portrait of gentle Jesus meek and mild  
I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child  
The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived  
They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived  
  
And they were surprised to see us  
So they greeted us with palms  
They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms  
I might recite a small prayer  
  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise  
  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial  
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye  
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme  
  
Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams  
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi  
For if I hold my hand outstretched  
A little bird comes to me  
  
I might recite a small prayer  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
Found myself in bedlam  
  
Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars  
Wailing echoes down the corridors  
The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""  
Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""  
  
And in this pit of sadness  
Where the rank of wretched plunge  
We've buried all the innocents  
Now we must bury revenge  
  
They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a
mustang  
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars
still spangle  
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine  
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to
Palestine  
  
Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces  
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces  
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance  
Though I seemed a long way from my home  
  
It really was no distance  
And I might recite a small prayer  
If I ever said them  
I lay down on an iron frame  
  
Found myself in bedlam  
Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause  
Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors  
And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause  
Wailing echoes down the corridors

"
951,Elvis Costello,Beyond Belief,"History repeats the old conceits  
The glib replies the same defeats  
Keep your finger on important issues  
With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues  
  
I'm just the oily slick  
On the windup world of the nervous tick  
In a very fashionable hovel  
  
I hang around dying to be tortured  
You'll never be alone in the bone orchard  
This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel  
  
So in this almost empty gin palace  
Through a two-way looking glass  
You see your Alice  
  
You know she has no sense  
For all your jealousy  
In a sense she still smiles very sweetly  
  
Charged with insults and flattery  
Her body moves with malice  
Do you have to be so cruel to be callous  
  
And now you find you fit this identikit completely  
You say you have no secrets  
And then leave discreetly  
  
I might make it California's fault  
Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault  
Just like the canals of mars and the great barrier reef  
I come to you beyond belief  
  
My hands were clammy and cunning  
She's been suitably stunning  
But I know there's not a hope in Hades  
All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle  
So-called gentlemen and ladies  
Dog fight like rose and thistle  
  
I've got a feeling  
I'm going to get a lot of grief  
Once this seemed so appealing  
Now I am beyond belief

"
952,Elvis Costello,Big Tears,"Everyone is busy with the regular routine  
The sniper just takes his aim  
Everyone is window shopping, no one is amazed  
Even if he hit you, you'd still think it's just a graze  
You go to a movie, you go to a show  
You think that you're living, you don't really know  
  
Big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
  
Oh, you talk about the new boss automatic clause  
But of course they make it all up for you  
Always fascinated by the weird edge of town  
Come home disappointed every time they put you down  
Laughing with the old boys, saying that it's all noise  
  
I suppose big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
  
All the buttons of my overcoat  
They have fallen off one by one  
You wouldn't even like me if you'd never had a drink  
You wouldn't even like me if you never stopped to think  
Standing in the shadow, turning wives to widows  
  
Don't you know big tears mean nothing  
You can count them as they fall  
Big tears mean nothing  
When you're lying in your coffin  
Tell me who's been taken in  
Tell me, me or yous been taken in  
Tell me, tell me, tell me

"
953,Elvis Costello,Black And White World,"I was looking at the black and white world  
It seemed so exciting  
If you'd only put me back to back with that girl  
When the night's inviting  
With just a little lighting  
There'll never be days like that again  
When I was just a boy and men were men  
You never go from moment to moment  
You're the living double of a single fiction  
You're very colourful with your compliments  
As you feel the finger's friction  
It's a freeze-frame  
Still it's real life  
You don't want to look  
Cause you've seen the film and you've read the book  
I was looking at the black and white world  
Trying to name some pin-up  
Those days she was just a beautiful girl  
Now she's framed and hung up  
I thought she was young  
Up until I saw her last night in close detail  
Though they all fade away when you're so pale  
It's more than just a physical attraction  
It starts with a face and ends up a fixation  
But you're never gonna feel a fraction  
Of the way it used to work on your imagination  
When you were looking at the black and white world...

"
954,Elvis Costello,Black Sails In The Sunset,"Vain boys are gonna have to swallow their pride this time  
So let the punishment fit the crime  
It's under the table  
Under your skin  
Into the cable  
Is this the death of the glory you're in?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black sails in the sunset  
White noise going yakety-yak  
All the money in the world will never bring your body back  
Is it some mysterious dance nobody can do?  
Thought I knew all the steps quite clearly  
I don't have a clue  
Oooh  
  
You're Cinderella with a ball and chain  
And the shoe seems to fit you  
You tell the truth sometimes but  
You wouldn't know it if it hit you  
Is this some new trick  
Wired up in your head?  
Do you make me sick  
Or was I just force fed?  
  
[Chorus]

"
955,Elvis Costello,Blame It On Cain,"Once upon a time, I had a little money  
Government burglars took it along  
Before I could mail it to you  
Still you are the only one  
Now I can't let it slip away  
So if the man with the ticker tape, he tries to take it  
Well, this is what I'm gonna say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Blame it on Cain  
Don't blame it on me  
Oh-oh, oh, it's nobody's fault  
But we need somebody to burn  
  
Well, if I was a saint with a silver cup  
And the money got low, we could always heat it up  
Or trade it in  
But then the radio to heaven will be wired to your purse  
And you can run down the waveband  
Coast-to-coast, hand in hand  
Bad to worse, curse for curse  
Don't be dissatisfied, so if you're not satisfied  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I think I've lived a little too long on the outskirts of town  
I think I'm going insane from talking to myself for so long  
Oh, but I've never been accused  
When they step on your face, then wear that good-look grin  
I gotta break out one weekend before I do somebody in  
But every single time I feel a little stronger  
They tell me it's a crime, well, how much longer?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Blame it on Cain,  
Oh-oh, oh, please don't blame it on me  
It's nobody's fault  
But it just seems to be his turn

"
956,Elvis Costello,Blue Chair,"Now it's just you and me, my blue friend  
And you say that it's you that she's thinking of and our affair must end  
But if it's you that she's thinking of  
I think my broken heart might mend  
  
Well, it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry, my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
Now I've made up my mind, I've made my mistake  
And I know that she cries for you when she's barely awake  
Well, she's going to bend your mind  
Well, I hope it don't break  
  
Now it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry, my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
We can watch our troubles rise  
Like smoke into the air and drift up to the ceiling  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
You can feel just like a boy or a man  
And next minute you can find yourself kneeling  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
They're boasting of loving the daylights  
Right out of her in the small hours  
  
(Down in the blue chair)  
You say, that your love lasts forever  
When you know the night is just ours, oh  
  
And still I want her right now  
Not in a minute, hour or day  
And wherever she is tonight, I want her anyway  
I suppose, she never said to you, you were just in the way  
  
Now it's my turn to talk, your turn to think  
Your turn to buy, my turn to drink  
Your turn to cry and my turn to sink  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue chair  
Down in the blue chair, down in the blue  
Blue becomes you  
Down in the blue chair

957,Elvis Costello,Brilliant Disguise,"(Bruce Springsteen)  
  
I hold you in my arms  
There's a band playing  
What are those words whispered, baby  
Just as you turn away?  
  
Well I saw you last night  
Out on the edge of town  
I wanna read your mind and know just what I got in this  
New thing I found  
  
So tell me what I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
I heard someone call your name  
Underneath my willow  
I saw something tucked in shame  
Underneath your pillow  
  
Well I tried so hard, baby  
But I just can't see  
What a woman like you  
Is doing with me  
  
So tell me who I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
Now look at me, baby  
Struggling to do everything right  
And then it all falls apart  
When out go the lights  
  
I'm just a lonely pilgrim  
I walk this world in wealth  
I wanna know it's you I don't trust  
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself  
  
Now you play the lovin' woman  
I play the faithful man  
Just don't look too close  
Into the palm of my hand  
  
When we stood at the altar  
The gypsy swore our future looked right  
But in the wee, wee hours, maybe baby,  
The gypsy lied  
  
So when you look at me  
You better look hard and look twice  
Is that me, baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise?  
  
Tonight our bed is cold  
I'm lost in the darkness of our love  
God have mercy on a man  
Who doubts what he's sure of

"
958,Elvis Costello,Brilliant Mistake,"He thought he was the King of America  
Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine  
Now I try hard not to become hysterical  
But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying  
I wish that I could push a button  
And talk in the past and not the present tense  
And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear  
Like it was common sense  
It was a fine idea at the time  
Now it's a brilliant mistake  
  
She said that she was working for the ABC News  
It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use  
Her perfume was unspeakable  
It lingered in the air  
Like her artificial laughter  
Her mementos of affairs  
""Oh"" I said ""I see you know him""  
""Isn't that very fortunate for you""  
And she showed me his calling card  
He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two  
He was a fine idea at the time  
Now he's a brilliant mistake  
  
He thought he was the King of America  
But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams  
A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals  
The words of love in whispers  
And the acts of love in screams  
I wish that I could push a button  
And talk in the past and not the present tense  
And watch this lovin' feeling disappear  
Like it was common sense  
I was a fine idea at the time  
Now I'm a brilliant mistake

"
959,Elvis Costello,Broken,"If I'm frightened then I can hide it  
If I'm crying, I'll call it laughter  
If I am haunted, I'll call it my imaginary friend  
If I am bleeding I'll call it wine  
  
But if you leave me then I am broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains  
  
If I am drifting, then I can fight it  
If I am sinking, no-one will know it  
If I am blinded I'll have my voices to guide me  
If they yet fled away I'd bless the silence  
  
But if you leave me then I'm broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains

"
960,Elvis Costello,Bullets For The New-Born King,"No one looks in this place for motive or any hope  
But for the dead shot of an amber glass  
The blue light of a votive  
  
Rain obscured the window  
As the pain was dulled by the grains  
Absolved by spoons in flames  
In fear in time dissolving  
  
It's not for the faint of pulse  
Or anybody false  
Those amateurs who simply shed their skins  
So where are those traitors now, we once called patriots?  
Just like those saints who seem to revel in their sins  
  
O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging  
After our assassin's work was done  
But bells in hands are only there for the wringing  
And we were bringing bullets for the new-born king  
  
Trumpet sounds lamenting  
Trampling down the blooms of the deceased  
The double agent girl and the fallen priest were heading for the border  
  
Somewhere in the high command there stayed the palest hand  
Who saw the order countermand  
Erased the tape recorder and then they hung him from a window cord  
  
Swallow down that voodoo vial and stay your breath a while  
Before we spill this tale that we had spun  
And now I shall now confide all that I have denied  
Oh I'm so sorry for the things I've done  
  
O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging  
After our assassin's work was done  
But bells in hands bells were only there for the ringing  
And we were bringing bullets for the new-born king

"
961,Elvis Costello,Busy Bodies,"So you think that you have seen her  
When you're lying in between her  
And you tell me that you don't care  
Busy bodies getting nowhere  
Ev'rybody's getting meaner  
Busy bodies  
Caught in the concertina  
  
You check her outline  
Break her regulations  
You watch her legs through several  
Service stations  
  
Busy bodies  
Very busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere  
  
Now you're ready for the merger  
With the company you're part of  
And you do the dirty business  
With your latest sleeping partner  
  
You're becoming  
Automatic  
Busy bodies  
Out playing with the traffic  
  
You want attention  
You try my patience  
With the best intentions you are nothing but a nuisance  
  
Busy bodies  
Busy busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere  
  
Now you've given your performance  
Though the matinee was idle  
And you find that a wave of her right hand  
Could seem so tidal  
  
Just a second  
Satisfaction  
Busy bodies  
Temporarily out of action  
  
You wash and brush up  
You want to dress up  
You want to kiss her  
But she's busy with her makeup  
  
Busy bodies  
Very busy  
Getting nowhere  
Nowhere [x6]

"
962,Elvis Costello,Can You Be True?,"Can you be true?  
Can this possibly be real?  
I knew quite suddenly  
Do you sense how I feel?  
I long to hear you whisper my name  
'Til you tell me  
""My Darling, you may be my man""  
  
There will be days when you must go from my sight  
There may be nights when clouds deny us starlight  
Only time will tell us  
I hope that it speaks gently if it isn't meant to be  
Then again  
By then we might not be listening so attentively  
  
I will be there  
If the days bring torments and trials  
To close the distances only measured in miles  
I long to hold you all through the night  
And to tell you  
""My Darling, you make everything seem right""  
And then I'll hear you calling in my name  
And I'll answer  
""My Darling, I may be your man""

"
963,Elvis Costello,Changing Partners,"We were dancing together to a dreamy melody  
When they called out ""Change partners""  
And you waltzed away from me  
Now my arms feel so empty  
As I gaze around the floor  
And I'll keep on changing partners  
Till I hold you once more  
  
Though we danced for one moment  
And too soon we had to part  
In that wonderful moment  
Somethin' happened to my heart  
So I'll keep changing partners  
Till you're in my arms again  
Oh, my darlin'  
I may never change partners again  
  
Though we danced for one moment  
And too soon we had to part  
In that wonderful moment  
Somethin' happened to my heart  
So I'll keep changing partners  
Till you're in my arms again  
Oh, my darlin'  
I will never change partners again  
Oh, my darlin'  
I will never change partners again

"
964,Elvis Costello,Charm School,"Men made out of monkeys  
Men made into mice  
Happy days are here again  
And all the drinks half price  
A girl with a trick and a man with a calling  
  
Trying to make a living out of your downfalling  
Trying to make a living out of anything at all  
Didn't they teach you anything except how to be cruel  
In that charm school  
  
You and I as lovers  
Were nothing but a farce  
Trying to make a silk purse  
Out of a sow's arse  
Saying 'why don't you watch me'  
Hardly speaking sotto voce  
  
I've got a notion  
I've got an angle  
Take your dreams and promises  
And put them through the mangle  
They say it's hell to finance too  
And I just want to romance you  
  
In this perpetual nightclub  
I'll be yours eternal  
Though the hours are long  
And the noise infernal  
Just one shameful act or sometimes two  
We make believe we're making do

"
965,Elvis Costello,Chelsea,"Photographs of fancy tricks  
To get your kicks at sixty-six  
He thinks of all the lips that he licks  
And all the girls that he's goin' to fix  
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle  
But there's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle  
Capital punishment, she's last year's model  
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no, it does not move me  
Even though I've seen the movie  
I don't want to check your pulse  
I don't want nobody else  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Everybody's got new orders  
Be a nice girl and kiss the warders  
Now the teacher is away  
All the kids begin to play  
Men come screaming, dressed in white coats  
Shake you very gently by the throat  
One's named Gus, one's named Alfie  
I don't want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no, it does not move me  
Even though I've seen the movie  
I don't want to check your pulse  
I don't want nobody else

"
966,Elvis Costello,Chemistry Class,"She throws back her hair [hands] and she shows you her mouth  
The breath that I waste trying to ruin your life  
Beauty's on a budget but you take it on the chin  
'Cause you have to do your duty taking orders from the kingpin  
  
[Chorus:]  
You've got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind  
You don't know what you started when you mixed it up with mine  
Are you ready for the final solution? Oh. Oh.  
  
[They] chopped you up in butcher's school  
Threw you out of the academy of garbage  
You'll be a joker all your life  
A student at the comedy college  
People pleasing people pleasing people like you  
You've been around so long but you still don't know what to do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sparks are flying from electrical pylons  
Snakes and ladders running up and down her nylons  
Ready to experiment, you're ready to be burned  
If it wasn't for some accidents then some would never ever learn  
  
[Chorus:]

"
967,Elvis Costello,Clubland,"With a handful of backhanders and a bevy of beauty  
You're going off limits  
Going off duty  
Going off the rails  
Going off with booty  
They tell tales of fiction found on all the criminal types  
Lead to a higher ranking man or a face with thin red stripes  
  
The boys next door  
The mums and dads  
New weds and nearly-deads  
Have you ever been had in clubland?  
  
There's a piece in someone's pocket to do the dirty work  
You've come to shoot the pony  
They've come to do the jerk  
They leave him half way to paradise  
They leave you half way to bliss  
The ladies' invitation never seemed like this  
  
The boys next door  
The mums and dads  
New weds and nearly-deads  
Have you ever been had in clubland?  
  
The long arm of the law slides up the outskirts of town  
Meanwhile in clubland they are ready to pull them down  
Hey  
  
The right to work is traded in for the right to refuse admission  
Don't pass out now, there's no refund  
(when) did you find out what you were missing  
The crowd is taking forty winks minus ten percent  
You barely get required sleep to go lingering with contemptment  
Thursday to Saturday  
Money's gone already  
Some things come in common these days  
Your hands and work aren't steady  
  
The boys next door  
The mums and dads  
New weds and nearly-deads  
Have you ever been had in clubland?

"
968,Elvis Costello,Couldn't Call It Unexpected No. 4,"I saw a girl who'd found her consolation  
She said ""One day my Prince of Peace will come""  
Above her head a portrait of her father  
The wilted favor that he gave her still fastened to the frame  
""They've got his bones and everything he owns  
I've got his name""  
  
Well you can laugh at this sentimental story  
But in time you'll have to make amends  
The sudden chill where lovers doubt their immortality  
As the clouds cover the sky the evening ends  
Describing a picture of eyes finally closing  
As you sometimes glimpse terrible faces in the fire  
We'll I'm the lucky goon  
Who composed this tune  
From birds arranged on the high wire  
  
Who on earth is tapping at the window?  
Does that face still linger at the pane?  
I saw you shiver though the room was like a furnace  
A shadow of regret across a young mother's face  
So toll the bell or rock the cradle  
Please don't let me fear anything I cannot explain  
I can't believe, I'll never believe in anything again

"
969,Elvis Costello,Crimes Of Paris,"I thought it was you and your optimist's view of the clock  
And how it's always another day  
Just after twelve o'clock's struck  
You said ""Now I only want you so I don't have to promise""  
But tiny children in grown-up clothes whispered all the Crimes of Paris  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're not the girl next-door or a girl from France  
Or the cigarette-girl in the sizzle hot-pants  
All the words of love seem cruel and crass  
When you're tough and transparent as armoured glass  
You're everywhere girl in an everyday mess  
Who'll pay for the Crimes of Paris  
  
I heard that you fell for the ""Hell or to Hammersmith Blues""  
In the tiny torn up pieces of his mind he's irresistible too  
Now it's hard to say now if he's only stupid or smart  
When he crawled through the door  
And poured out more of his creeping-Jesus heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And it's all here and now  
She hit him with that paper-weight Eiffel Tower  
And I tried to hold on to you but I don't know how  
And I find it hard to swallow good advice  
Like going down three times to only come up twice  
  
She's so convenient, he's always stiff as hair-lacquer  
It's hard to discover now he's in love with her  
It was her way of getting her own back  
You never did anything she couldn't do on her own  
You're as good as your word and that's no good to her  
You'd better leave that kitten alone  
  
[Chorus:]

"
970,Elvis Costello,"Cry, Cry, Cry","Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down  
They say you only live to see the lights of town  
I wasted my time when i would try, try, try  
'cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone  
And you'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone  
You'll come to me but i'm gonna tell you bye, bye, bye  
When i turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone  
When everyone's forgotten and you're on your own  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry  
  
I lie awake at night and wait till you come in  
You stay a little while and then you're gone again  
Every question that i ask, i get a lie, lie, lie  
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry  
  
When your fickle little love gets old, no one will care for you  
You'll come back to me for a little love that's true  
I'll tell you no and you're gonna ask me why, why, why  
When i remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry  
  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me there  
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been  
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

"
971,Elvis Costello,Dr. Luther's Assistant,"Everything seems so tranquil  
Home movies with no subtitles  
Don't you wish you knew what they were sayin'  
When the film keeps playin', playin'  
  
Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance  
  
Some say he is just a lackey  
Changing words while the ink is still tacky  
He's absolutely indispensable  
He keeps the other boys in suspense  
  
Oh, he's Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance  
  
Luther is locked in a broken-down cinema  
Watches his wife with his video camera  
Sees his best boy makin' her grin  
Out of the kitchen, she's gone with the wind  
  
Oh, Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll close in, when he seems so distant  
Doctor Luther's assistant  
He'll get on top of you when you lower your resistance

"
972,Elvis Costello,Dust 2...,"If dust could only talk  
What would we hear it say?  
Before it's brushed aside  
Just as it's swept away  
  
It's just the evidence  
It's of no consequence  
It's only flesh and bone  
Why don't you leave it alone?  
  
If dust could only speak  
Caught in a falling beam  
If dust could only cry  
If dust could only scream  
For it's the single witness that might testify  
Could I spit out the truth?  
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  
  
But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint  
Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints  
And in the theater curtain where they hang a drape  
Or in the ticket pocket where your hands escape  
  
Before they start to wander  
Or they start to shrink  
You rub your eye a little and appear to blink  
And then she caught you staring  
She knows just what you're thinking  
What got into you was not a ghost as such  
It was just dust  
  
Here comes the juggernaut  
Here come the poisoners  
They choke the life and land  
And rob the joy from us  
Why do they taste of sugar  
Oh, when they're made of money  
Here comes the lamb of God  
And the butcher's boy, Sonny  
  
Well I believe we just  
Become a speck of dust...

"
973,Elvis Costello,Episode Of Blonde,"I spy for the ""Spirit of Curiosity""  
All the scandals of each vain monstrosity  
I gossip and I pry and I insinuate  
If the failure is great  
Then it tends to fascinate  
  
A tornado dropped a funnel cloud with twenty tons of rain  
Though she had the attention span of warm cellophane  
Her lovers fell like skittles in a 10-pin bowling lane  
But nothing could compare with that explosion of fame  
  
So you jumped back with alarm  
Every Elvis has his army  
Every rattlesnake its charm  
Can you still hear me?  
Am I coming through just fine?  
Your memory was buried in a simple box of pine  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?  
Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?  
It's such a shame you had to break the heart  
You could have counted on but the last thing you need is another  
...Episode of blonde  
  
Revolving like a jeweler's figure on a music box  
Spangled curtain parted and a night-club scene unlocks  
Pinned and fixed and fastened in a follow spot  
Arms thrown out to everyone, she's giving all she's got  
To the last gasp of a wounded bandeon  
Tiny man imploring to the ceiling fan  
This stolen feeling  
Amplified up through a busted speaker  
Blaring, blasting, advertising, distorted beyond reason  
Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards,  
Half out of the taxi cab the barker seized my elbow  
He thought I was another lonely, likely pilgrim looking for St.Telmo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tried to keep a straight face but you know it never pays  
He would stare into those eyes and then vacation in her gaze  
She was a cute little ruin that he pulled out of the rubble  
Noe they are both living in a soft soap bubble  
  
The film producer's contemplating, entertaining suicide  
The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride  
The timepiece stretched across a wrist  
She couldn't care less cast aside  
The scent that so repelled him that he swore: ""insecticide""  
And there's a farewell note to mother  
That will conclude ""Your loving Son""  
""Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done.""  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So an artist drags a toothbrush across the first thing that he sees  
And names the painting ""Christ's Last Exit into Purgatory""  
Receiving secret messages from an alien intelligence  
Paying off his stalker it's a legitimate expense  
So paste up pictures of those shrill and hollow girls  
With puckered lips  
She's a trophy on your arm  
A magnet for your money clip  
The moral of this story is the sorry tale to say  
They're pieced with links of chains so they can never run away

974,Elvis Costello,Everybody's Crying Mercy,"I can't believe the things I've seen  
I wonder bout some things I've heard  
Everybody's crying mercy  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
  
A bad enough situation  
Is sure enough getting worse  
Everybody's crying justice  
Just as long as there's business first  
Toe to toe  
Touch and go  
Give a cheer  
Get your souvenir  
  
People running round in circles  
Don't know what they're headed for  
Everybody's crying peace on Earth  
Just as soon as we win this war  
  
Straight ahead  
Knock em dead  
Pack your kid  
Choose your hypocrite  
  
Well you don't have to go to off Broadway  
To see something played absurd  
Everybody's crying mercy  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word  
When they don't know the meaning of the word  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word  
Nobody knows the meaning of the word

975,Elvis Costello,Everyday I Write The Book,"Don't tell me you don't know what love is  
When you're old enough to know better  
When you find strange hands in your sweater  
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote  
I'm a man with a mission on two or three editions.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book.  
Chapter One: We didn't really get along.  
Chapter Two: I think I fell in love with you.  
You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three  
  
But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four  
Five and Six.  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
The way you walk  
The way you talk and try to kiss me  
And laugh in four or five paragraphs.  
All your compliments and your cutting remarks  
Are captured here in my quotation marks.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
Everyday I write the book.  
Don't tell me you don't know the difference  
Between a lover and a fighter.  
With my pen and my electric typewriter  
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal  
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel.  
  
And I'm giving you a longing look...  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book.  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday  
Everyday I write the book...

"
976,Elvis Costello,Expert Rites,"I marvel at the wonder of it in our soulless age  
Fast flow the tears upon the page  
Don't be alarmed I am her friend  
Will I be excused if I presume  
It's more than disappointment that we share  
You share the same sorry life, the families fight,  
That unhappy blade you both invite  
This romantic ideal has a lonely appeal  
I once loved someone the way that you do  
But I had to let her go  
I live with my regret  
Don't despair my would-be Juliet

"
977,Elvis Costello,Fallen,"All the leaves are turning yellow, red and brown  
Soon they'll be scattered as they tumble down  
Although they may be swept up so invitingly  
  
I never did what I was told  
I trampled through the amber and the burnished gold  
But now I clearly see how cruel the young can be  
  
You can convince yourself of anything  
If you wish both hard and long  
And I believed that life was wonderful  
Right up to the moment when love went wrong  
I gaze up at the tree-tops and laugh  
I need somebody to shake me loose  
I want to know what happens next  
'Til I don't care at all  
There I go  
Beginning to fall

"
978,Elvis Costello,Favourite Hour,"Figure hanging on a leather band  
Cog consults the watch he cups in his hand  
Bejewelled movement measures lost and vanished time  
Pray for the boy who makes his bed in cold earth and quicklime  
  
[Chorus:]  
So stay the hands, arrest the time  
Till I am captured by your touch  
Blessings I don't count  
Small mercies and such  
The flags may lower as we approach the favorite hour  
  
Now there's a tragic waste of brutal youth  
Strip and polish this unvarnished truth  
The tricky door that gapes beneath the ragged noose  
The crippled verdict begs again for the lamest excuse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Put out my eyes so I may never spy  
Waving branches as they're waving goodbye  
Their vile perfume brings to my mouth a bitter taste  
The murmuring brooks had best speak up, it's a terrible waste  
  
[Chorus]

"
979,Elvis Costello,Fish 'n' Chip Paper,"When Sunday morning dandruff turns out to be confetti  
And the cost of living in sin would make a poor man out of Paul Getty  
The girl in your dreams would have you up on an under age charge  
And the man of the moment is the lifer at large  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you've got something to hide, if you've got something to sell  
If you've got somebody's pride she might kiss and tell  
Or wind up with a fight fan in the Hammersmith Hotel  
You better speak up now if you want your piece  
You better speak up now  
It won't mean a thing later  
Yesterday's news is tomorrow's fish and chip paper  
  
Your girl says she's leaving and this time she really means it  
You can just look at the pictures, you don't actually have to read it  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
There's a man in the launderette and he's looking through your underwear  
For clues  
And the milkman is working through the News of the Screws  
  
He says...  
[Chorus:]

"
980,Elvis Costello,From A Whisper To A Scream,"Oh it's not easy to resist temptation  
Walking around looking like a figment of somebody else's imagination  
Taking ev'ry word she says just like an open invitation  
But the power of persuasion is no match for anticipation  
  
Like a finger running down a seam  
From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream  
But don't get me wrong  
Please don't leave me waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Hey  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh if the customers like it then they'll keep on paying  
If they keep on drinking then they'll end up staying  
I heard someone say where have we met before  
But the one over the eight seem less like one or more like four  
  
Like a finger running down a seam  
From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream  
But don't get me wrong  
Please don't leave me waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Waitin' too long  
Hey

"
981,Elvis Costello,From Head To Toe,"Oh, well, now you're the girl I'm simply mad about.  
Oh yes, I'm really glad it's been me. Oh yeah.  
I hope that you've been getting ready,  
Cause I'm gonna ask you to go steady with me.  
I got two eyes that happened by ya,  
And when they saw you, they said they knew you were fine.  
I got two lips that long to kiss you,  
And when they speak, they say they wish you were mine.  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
Oh, I got a little heart inside me beating  
And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time.  
You better watch out 'cause of what I say  
Cause baby, don't you know that I ain't playing a game?  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
All the way down from the top to the ground, sweet baby.  
  
I got two legs and I got two feet that always take me to your street  
Everyday, all the time.  
No matter which way I try to go, my legs and my feet  
They seem to know the way.  
  
Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.  
All the way down from the top to the ground. Hey, sweet baby.  
I am yours from head to toe. Sweet baby.

"
982,Elvis Costello,Georgia And Her Rival,"Georgie grew to hate her name  
It sounded like a tiny man  
And the one she had said, ""I can't see you  
But I'll call you whenever I can""  
  
Sometimes the phone would ring, when she was half-asleep  
A voice would drag her down with its suggestions  
Though she often felt cheated  
She never felt cheap  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
It was half-past February  
And he hadn't called since New Year's Day  
Maybe he'd found another woman  
To say those words no chapel girl should say  
  
Her mother would phone and always keep her talking  
She'd try to be polite, making faces  
But somewhere in the back of her mind  
Her rival was stalking  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Her rival would always wait  
'Til the eighth or ninth bell  
He'd be desperate anyway  
And drunk as well  
  
She always liked to hurt him  
To prove he was prepared  
To love her anyway that she wanted  
So she could tell which she preferred  
  
He sat up with his address book  
Trying to think what mood he's in  
His finger traced past Georgie's name  
To someone who needed less persuading  
  
He didn't hear through her disguise  
He didn't leave her in a rush  
Just like the promise that he left  
On her machine that almost made her blush  
  
The radio plays a lover's symphony  
The number you have dialed has been re-directed  
Now she puts him on the speaker-phone  
Whenever she has company  
  
Well, heaven knows what fills the heart  
And makes you feel so alive  
It's impossible to tear apart  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival  
Georgie and her rival

"
983,Elvis Costello,I Turn Around,"Sometimes I try so hard to resist, you say you will and I say you won't.  
Sometimes I think that you don't exsist and sometimes you don't.  
Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.  
Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.  
You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.  
Count 10 and then down again.  
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
Doing everything they say shouldn't be done,  
More fun than you can have with your clothes on.  
Pinch me 'cause I don't believe it.  
Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
You're determined to make me as miserable as you can.  
You're like Harry Houdini or the Invisible Man.  
I turn around and you're not there.  
Why must it always be the less I see of you, the more I care?  
The less I see of you, the more I care.  
The less I see of you, the more I care.

"
984,Elvis Costello,I Wanna Be Loved,"Why must I be so lonely?  
When so many people pass me by  
I've been waiting for oh so long now  
And yet I'm unable to answer why  
I can't be made to give up now  
Can you find room for me  
In your heart somehow?  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
  
I guess I'm a victim of loneliness  
But why should this be my destiny?  
A foolish man for a lot of my life  
Shouldn't there be someone  
Someone for me?  
I hope and I pray some happy day  
That I'll be around to hear you say  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved

"
985,Elvis Costello,I Want To Vanish,"I want to vanish  
This is my fondest wish  
To go where I cannot be captured  
Laid on a decorated dish  
Even in splendor this curious fate  
Is more than I care to surrender  
Now it's too late  
  
Whether in wonder or indecent haste  
You arrange the mirrors and the spools  
To snare the rare and precious jewels  
That were only made of paste  
  
If you should stumble upon my last remark  
I'm crying in the wilderness  
I'm trying my best to make it dark  
How can I tell you I'm rarer than most  
I'm certain as a lost dog  
Pondering a sign post  
  
Whether in wonder or indecent haste  
You arrange the mirrors and the spools  
To snare the rare and precious jewels  
That were only made of paste  
  
I want to vanish  
This is my last request  
I've given you the awful truth  
Now give me my rest

"
986,Elvis Costello,I Want You,"Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell  
I don't think I can live without you  
And I know that I never will  
Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death  
I can't say anymore than ""I love you""  
Everything else is a waste of breath  
  
I want you  
You've had your fun you don't get well no more  
I want you  
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall  
Be careful darling you might fall  
I want you  
I woke up and one of us was crying  
I want you  
You said ""Young man I do believe you're dying""  
I want you  
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days  
I want you  
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways  
  
I want you  
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget  
I want you  
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate  
I want you  
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for  
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for  
I want you  
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing  
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing  
  
I want you  
He tossed some tatty compliment your way  
I want you  
And you were fool enough to love it when he said  
""I want you""  
  
I want you  
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark  
It scares you witless  
But in time you see things clear and stark  
I want you  
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop  
I want you  
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop  
I want you  
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you  
I want you  
I want to know the things you did that we do too  
I want you  
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do  
I want you  
I might as well be useless for all it means to you  
I want you  
Did you call his name out as he held you down  
I want you  
Oh no my darling not with that clown  
I want you  
  
I want you  
You've had your fun you don't get well no more  
I want you  
No-one who wants you could want you more  
  
I want you  
  
I want you  
  
I want you  
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up  
I want you  
  
I'm going to say it again 'til I instill it  
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it  
I want you  
  
I want you  
  
I want you

"
987,Elvis Costello,I'll Never Fall In Love Again,"What do you get when you fall in love?  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
What do you get when you kiss a girl  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia  
After you do, she'll never phone you  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you give your heart  
You get it all broken up and battered  
That's what you get, a heart that's shattered  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You only get lies and pain and sorrow  
So for at least until tomorrow  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again

"
988,Elvis Costello,I'm In The Mood Again,"Hail to the taxis  
They go where I go  
Farewell the newspapers that know more than I know  
Flung under a street-lamp still burning at dawn  
I'm in the mood again  
  
I walk the damp streets rather than slumber  
Along the fine windows of shameless and plunder  
But none of their riches could ever compare  
I'm in the mood again  
  
I don't know what's come over me  
But it's nothing that I'm doing wrong  
You took the breath right out of me  
Now you'll find it in the early hours  
In a lover's song  
  
I lay my head down on fine linens and satin  
Away from the mad-hatters who live in Manhattan  
The Empire State Building illuminating the sky  
I'm in the mood  
I'm in the mood  
I'm in the mood again

"
989,Elvis Costello,I'm Not Angry,"You're upstairs with the boyfriend while I'm left here to listen (Angry)  
I hear you calling his name, I hear the stutter of ignition (Angry)  
I could hear you whispering as I crept by your door  
So you found some other joker who could please you more  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)  
Ooh, I know what you're doin'  
I know where you've been  
I know where, but I don't care  
'Cause there's-a no such thing as an original sin  
  
I've got this camera click, click, clickin' in my head (Angry)  
I got you talking with your hands, got you smiling with your legs (Angry)  
Spent all my time in a vanity factory  
Wonderin' when they're gonna come and take it all back  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh, there's no such thing as an original sin  
Oh, there's-a no such thing as an original sin (Angry)  
I'm not angry (Angry)  
I'm not angry anymore (Angry)...

"
990,Elvis Costello,Indoor Fireworks,"We play these parlour games  
We play at make believe  
When we get to the part where I say that I'm going to leave  
Everybody loves a happy ending but we don't even try  
We go straight past pretending  
To the part where everybody loves to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
Indoor fireworks  
Can still burn your fingers  
Indoor fireworks  
We swore we were safe as houses  
They're not so spectacular  
They don't burn up in the sky  
But they can dazzle or delight  
Or bring a tear  
When the smoke gets in your eyes  
  
You were the spice of life  
The gin in my vermouth  
And though the sparks would fly  
I thought our love was fireproof  
Sometimes we'd fight in public darling  
With very little cause  
But different kinds of sparks would fly  
When we got on our own behind closed doors  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time to tell the truth  
These things have to be faced  
My fuse is burning out  
And all that powder's gone to waste  
Don't think for a moment dear that we'll ever be through  
I'll build a bonfire of my dreams  
And burn a broken effigy of me and you  
  
[Chorus]

"
991,Elvis Costello,It Tears Me Up (Live),"I see you walk with him  
I see you talk to him  
It tears me up, oh, it tears me up  
And I can't stop crying  
Oh, baby, I can't stop crying  
  
I see you kiss his lips  
And squeeze his fingertips  
It tears me up, oh, baby, it tears me up  
And there's nothing I can do about it  
  
Oh, baby, baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
It's a faithless world we're livin' in  
When I turn around and there you are with my best friend  
Sometimes when you pass me on the street  
  
You look at me as if to say I'm sorry my, sweet  
And being sorry might be enough  
Then you look back at him and [unverified] a smile  
And that makes me feel kinda rough  
  
Oh, darlin', it tears me up  
I see you smile at him  
You never tire of him  
It tears me up  
  
Oh, baby, it tears me up  
There's nothing I can do about it  
Baby, can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
  
Oh, it tears me up so bad  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
Tears me up so bad  
Can't you see I'm still in love with you?  
Still hungry for something I can't have  
  
Baby, please, please, please  
I'm still hungry for something I can't have  
It tears me up so bad  
Oh, oh, it tears me up so bad  
Tears me up so bad

"
992,Elvis Costello,It's Time,"The party's over  
Your time is up  
You've had your last pointless teardrop  
Washed down in that broken coffee cup  
This magic moment concludes when that cigarette ends  
Did you get what you wanted?  
Well I suppose that depends  
Well I suppose that depends  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you go, if you go  
Where passion is squandered and money is spent  
It's time, it's time  
It's time, it's time  
It's time, it's time, it's time  
  
You must see it's time that you went  
You must see it's time that you went  
Our brief acquaintance was such a mistake  
Now it seems more like a sentence  
Or something you always had to fake  
This magic moment concludes when they turn out the light  
It's not the days when you leave me  
But all I fear are the nights  
But all I fear are the nights  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You told the same joke to me too many times  
I wish that someone would hit it  
Just before you reach  
Just before you reach  
Just before you reach the punchline  
The party's over  
Time we broke up  
It always seemed like a bad dream  
One where I finally woke up  
This magic moment concluding our mutual fate  
But if you do have to leave me  
Who will I have left to hate?  
Who will I have left to hate?  
  
[Chorus]

993,Elvis Costello,"Jacksons, Monk And Rowe","Sisters four and brothers three  
Hanging off the family tree  
Practicing for getting old  
Do you want your fortune told  
They're looking for you high and low  
Now there's nowhere for you to go  
So you'll just have to come out and face the music  
Jacksons, monk and Rowe  
  
Long ago when we were kids and we cut your hair to bits  
As we carried off like spoils the heads we'd smash right off  
Your dolls  
But the wind is changing you know  
Are you sure of your friends and your foe  
Have you got what it takes to carry it off  
Jacksons, Monk and Rowe  
  
As the sun beats down and life begins to complicate  
Will we both incinerate  
If we touch that brass name-plate  
  
Messrs. all, noble sirs  
Highly paid solicitors  
Find enclosed my signed divorce  
Sad proceedings you endorse  
The burden of pity will show  
In the people we used to know  
Have you got enough strength to carry it off  
Jacksons, Monk and Rowe

994,Elvis Costello,Jimmie Standing In The Rain,"Third-class ticket in his pocket  
Punching out the shadows underneath the sockets  
Tweed coat turned up against the fog  
Slow coaches rolling o'er the moor  
Between the very memory  
And approaches of war  
  
Stale bread curling on a luncheon counter  
Loose change lonely, not the right amount  
Forgotten man of an indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Nobody wants to buy a counterfeited prairie lullaby in a colliery town  
The hip flask and fumbled skein of some stage door Josephine is all he'll get
now  
Eyes going in and out of focus  
Mild and bitter from tuberculosis  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Her soft breath was gentle on his neck  
If he could choose the time to die  
Then he would come and go like this  
Underneath a painted sky  
  
She woke up and called him ""Charlie"" by mistake  
And then in shame began to cry  
Tarnished silver band peels off a phrase  
And then warms their hands around the brazier  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Brilliantine glistening  
Your soft plaintive whistling  
And your wan wandering smile  
Died down at The Hippodrome  
Now you're walking off to jeers, the lonely sound of jingling spurs,  
The ""toodle-oos"" and ""Oh, my dears"" down at ""The Argyle""  
  
Vile vaudevillians applaud sobriety  
There's no place for a half-cut cowboy in polite society  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain

995,Elvis Costello,Joe Porterhouse,"The children sit upon the stairs  
High above a valley of tears  
Don't let them see you crying that way oh no  
  
Oh no Joe Porterhouse  
Is not gone forever  
He'll be back another day  
Don't let them see you crying that way  
  
[Chorus]  
Please don't wake him let him sleep  
It' s a moment she can keep  
Like an old bus ticket or a photograph  
Resting on the mantelpiece  
While for the wicked there is no peace  
She says it's not his time to go  
Why we were nearly lovers years ago  
Now what is left for me  
Among the broken branches of the family tree  
  
Heart like an anchor  
Arms like cable  
He stood all alone on an iron turntable  
Don't let them see you crying that way oh no  
  
The sun beats down  
It's cracking the flags  
Boys who should know better  
Are stamping out fags  
Don't let them see you laughing that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no Joe Porterhouse  
Is not gone forever  
He'll be back another day  
Don't let them see you crying that way

"
996,Elvis Costello,Just A Memory,"Layin' about, lyin' in bed  
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said  
With the tempo of today and the temptation of tomorrow  
I don't know if I could give you anything but sorrow  
They stay alive this late on Radio Five  
But the pen that I write with won't tell the truth  
Cause the moments that I can't recall  
Are the moments that you treasure  
Better take another measure for measure  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Now you're here, I'm here too  
Could be this easy for me and you  
  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
Losing you is just a memory  
Memories don't mean that much to me  
  
Lyin' about layin' in bed  
Maybe it was something that I thought I'd said

"
997,Elvis Costello,Kid About It,"He saw no tears in her eyes  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
She's telling all of those lies  
She swore she'd never told before  
But I doubt it  
  
So he bit his tongue  
And tried hard to capture his breath  
When she said I waited all my life  
For just a little death  
  
[Chorus:]  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
  
Sometimes he takes himself so seriously  
She makes her movements mysteriously  
Slow fast or furiously  
It's a big responsibility  
With a face full of mixed ability  
Big dreams of elegance  
Singing the leaving of Liverpool  
And turning into Americans  
  
Say you wouldn't kid about it  
So what if this is a man's world  
I want to be a kid again about it  
Give me back my sadness  
I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl  
  
We fight so frail  
Making love tooth and nail  
You gave me the kiss of my life  
I might even live to tell the tale  
  
[Chorus:]

"
998,Elvis Costello,King Horse,"Cheap cut satin and bad perfume  
Showtime is almost here  
Teased up by a strip cartoon  
Laughing up your sleeve  
Sniggering in your beer  
He'd seen the bottom of a lot of glasses  
But he'd never seen love so near  
He'd seen love get so expensive  
But he'd never seen love get so dear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I know that you're all King Horse  
Between tenderness and brute force (repeat)  
  
She can turn upon a sixpence in the mouth and trousers set  
Hit the bill, ring the bell, never spill a sip  
And still she knows the kind of tip that she is gonna get  
A lot of loose exchanges, precious little respect  
When it's someone else's weekend  
That's the best you can expect  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So fond of the fabric  
So fond of fabrication  
From comic books to tragic  
Through the heart of complications  
Meanwhile back in some secluded spot  
He says 'will you please?' and she says 'stop'  
If I ever lose this good thing that I've got  
I never want to hear the song you dedicated tonight  
'Cause I knew that song so long before we met  
That it means much more than it might  
  
[Chorus:]

"
999,Elvis Costello,Lovable,"[Chorus:]  
It's going round the town  
It's going round the town  
It's going round the town  
You're so lovable  
  
My baby gave me notice to quit  
I just can't get used to it  
She broke my little heart in two  
Now somebody else is being the same old you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My baby has Egyptian eyes  
And a wicked look beyond compare  
If you thought I was a fool for you  
Then I must be a bigger fool for her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He'd turn the flowers of springtime into a wreath  
He says he'd love you eternally  
I say please please can't you keep it brief  
  
They say they're going to bury you  
Because you're so lovable  
Put your money where your mouth was  
You're so lovable  
Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam  
You're so lovable  
The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom  
You're so lovable  
  
You're so sweet  
You're so honest  
You say 'I'll be true to you boy'  
But I won't promise  
Then you say you love me  
Then you show me  
As you lie there so lifelike below me  
  
[Chorus]

"
1000,Eurythmics,17 Again,"Yay though we venture through  
The valley of the stars  
You and all your jewelry  
And my bleeding heart  
  
Who couldn't be together  
And who could not be apart  
  
We should've jumped out  
Of that airplane after all  
Flying sky ways overhead  
It wasn't hard to fall  
And I had so many crashes  
That I couldn't feel at all  
  
And it feels like  
I'm seventeen again  
Feels like I'm seventeen  
  
Times might break you  
God forsake you  
Leave you burned and bruised  
Innocence will teach you  
What it feels like to be used  
Thought that you'd done everything  
You didn't have a clue  
  
And it feels like  
I'm seventeen again  
Feels like I'm seventeen  
  
Looking from the outside in  
Some things never change  
Hey hey I'm a million miles away  
Funny how it seems like yesterday  
  
All those fake celebrities  
And all those viscous queens  
All the stupid papers  
And the stupid magazines  
Sweet dreams are made of anything  
That gets you in the scene  
  
And it feels like  
I'm seventeen again  
Feels like I'm seventeen  
  
Sweet dreams are made of this  
Who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something  
Yeah

1001,Eurythmics,A Cat With A Tale,"Three thirty on a sick summer's day  
I round myself staring at a Newcastle bus stop  
A total stranger in a herringbone suit  
Asked me the time through his cigarette lighter  
Fifteen years later on a Wednesday night  
L round myself dreaming in a Manchester night-club  
A total stranger in a luminous tracksuit  
Gives me a kiss and he tastes of aluminium  
Then he's gone  
And in his place a cat with green eyes  
A cat with no tall at all  
Just a very sad expression on his race  
Mandarin quotes on a wrought iron gate  
I'm ringing the doorbell, but the petrol keeps leaking  
A total stranger in a cashmere coat  
Tells me politely, ""Your wife is on fire""  
A family outing at the Gosforth Park Hotel  
The girl in the kitchen is working a job scheme  
L told my wife I'm sure I've seen her before  
She told me I kissed her al a Newcastle bus stop  
Then I was gone  
And in my place a cat with green eyes  
A cat with a tale to tell

"
1002,Eurythmics,A Little Of You,"There used to be a time  
I wore my heart upon my sleeve.  
There used to be a time  
I'd show my gentle side to anyone  
Through these years of wandering  
I know I've been deceived.  
Through these years of wandering  
  
And every time you try to hurt me  
You know you'll only hurt yourself.  
And every time you try to hurt me  
I know you'll be the one to suffer  
When you think you're hurting someone.  
  
A little of you, a little of me,  
A little of you,  
Is hurting someone  
  
Don't tell me I'm the only one  
'Cause I don't need that space.  
Don't ask for love  
I'll throw it back in your face.  
All of these promises  
Were only made to break.  
All of these promises

1003,Eurythmics,Adrian,"Adrian, don't you understand?  
Fools like us are always dreaming.  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
It's better if you try to stop remembering.  
  
And the world is slowly dawning  
To wake up to a new clear morning.  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off, page by page  
  
Adrian don't you understand?  
Fools like us are always dreaming.  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
It's better if you try to stop remembering.  
  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off page by page  
And the world is softly sleeping  
While your fears are in their keeping  
  
All the planet's making haste  
To blow to bits in outer space  
Adrian - don't you understand?

"
1004,Eurythmics,All The Young,"Young girls  
Not so innocent  
Will give you wide eyes  
Will show you knowing smiles  
  
Young men  
An air of independence  
Will take you at their leisure  
They live for pleasure  
  
All the young people of today  
  
Young girls  
An air of mystery  
Are dreaming from their towers  
They smell of flowers  
  
Young men  
They can do anything  
They are set to win  
With unmatched power  
  
All the young people of today

"
1005,Eurythmics,Anything But Strong,"Why do you hurt yourself?  
You do it very well  
You do it so politely  
That you couldn't even tell  
When everything has changed  
You think you're not to blame  
How come you keep on talking  
When the whole thing feels so strange?  
But seeing  
Is not the same as believing  
When everything goes wrong  
You're anything but strong  
It's all bittersweet  
Outside in the street  
The grass is growing greener  
Underneath your feet  
We come and go  
Deep water flows  
Tiny leaves from small seeds  
To tall trees do grow  
But wanting  
Is not the same thing as needing  
There's no need to pretend  
You can't turn back again  
And loving  
Is so different to keeping  
The hurting that we send  
Is so difficult to mend  
Hold on to the good things  
That keep you from falling down  
Hold on to the good things  
That keep you from falling down  
How my heart aches  
More than I can take  
What are we really learning  
When we make the same mistakes?  
Where is your hope?  
It's all gone up in smoke  
You used to be so funny  
Now it's just the same old joke  
And laughing  
Is so very close to crying  
When there's nothing to defend  
It gets you in the end  
And living  
Is so very close to dying  
You struggle on and on  
To find where you belong  
Where do you belong?  

"
1006,Eurythmics,Awol,"Kat was in the bedroom  
Playing hidehideho  
Lou was in the kitchen  
Kissing Michelangelo  
Ray was in a coffin  
Taking measurements  
With string  
Jean was cleaning  
Windows trying to  
Teach the world to sing  
The satellite was beaming  
In a cabaret show were  
Juliet was arguing with stupid romeo  
The dog was reading poetry by  
Poe and valerie  
And I was sat there thinking  
How happy we could be  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I don't know why  
We're off to see the wizard!  
A.W.O.L.  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now the sneaky fat magician  
He stole my handkerchief  
He blew his nose and gave  
Himself 20 years of grief  
And I was so dumbfounded  
When he asked me for a loan  
I told him to repeat it  
To my tiny dictaphone  
And all the lazy bastards  
That ever walked the earth  
Were trying to get hold of me  
From Tokyo to Perth  
But I was up the cundy  
Combing my goatee  
You thought I was surrounded  
But with one bound ... our hero was free  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I don't know why  
We're off to see the wizard!  
A.W.O.L.  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now all you gay lieutenants  
Who follow the yellow brick  
Be sure to take your happy pills  
Before you get seasick  
The journey is long-winded  
With many twists and snakes  
And I forgot to mention  
There were never any breaks

"
1007,Eurythmics,Baby's Gonna Cry,"Do you feel sorry lover?  
Do you feel blue?  
What reason did you have  
To be untrue?  
Now you could be so good  
But you have to be so bad  
When you could make me  
Happy lover  
You make me sad.  
  
Now there's a cool breeze blowin'  
Blowin' out the flame  
That used to burn inside me  
At the mention of your name,  
Now there's a cool breeze blowin'  
Blowin' down the track -  
That's where I'm goin'  
And I'm never comin' back...  
  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
My my - baby's gonna cry  
Tonight - oh yea...  
  
Now there's nothing  
Comes from nothing  
That's what they always say  
Didn't mama tell ya  
That's the price you have to pay?  
Now you can't have  
Your piece of cake  
And eat the sweet thing too  
But that kind of understanding  
Isn't good enough for you  
My my - baby's gonna cry

"
1008,Eurythmics,Beethoven,"Take a girl like that  
And put her in a natural setting  
Like a cafe for example.  
Along comes the boy  
And he's looking for trouble  
With a girl like that  
With a girl like that.  
Who knows what they'll decide to do.  
Who knows what they'll get up to.  
I'd love to know.  
Wouldn't you?  
  
I love to listen to beethoven...  
  
You think you know just what you want  
But you have used that weapon agianst me.  
Did I tell you I was lying by the way  
When I said I wanted a new mink coat.  
I was just thinking about  
Something sleek  
To wrap around my tender throat  
I was dreaming like a texan girl  
A girl who thinks she's got the right to everything.  
A girl who thinks she should have  
Something extreme.  
  
I love to listen to beethoven...

1009,Eurythmics,Belinda,"Belinda the rain is falling  
Belinda your love is calling  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
Belinda your mind is dreaming  
Belinda it's so misleading  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
How the rain still falls  
  
Belinda your eyes have spoken  
Belinda your heart is broken  
Belinda he'd never leave you  
Belinda he won't deceive you  
  
Dry your tears  
Close your eyes

1010,Eurythmics,Better To Have Lost In Love,"Cool tears flow upon my pillow.  
And i'm freezing blue with misery.  
You know that i never meant to hurt you  
But something always gets right in the way.  
  
So i'll fill this bedrom full of mystery.  
Hang our last conclusions on the wall.  
And if this empty building starts to get to me  
Please remember that it just might be your fault.  
  
Better to have lost in love  
Than never to have loved at all...  
  
So the fated lovers turn to enemies -  
And all their hidden feelings start to show.  
And i never though that boy  
Could mean so much to me.  
And now it seems i'll have to let you go...

"
1011,Eurythmics,Caveman Head,"Feel my body breathing in  
Touch the softness of my skin  
I am very beautiful  
I can be so beautiful  
I am very beautiful  
I could be successful  
My hands are moving  
My feet are tied  
Watch the way my hair falls down  
See the way my hair falls down  
I am very beautiful  
I can be so beautiful  
Touch the softness of my skin  
Feel my body breathing in  
My hands are moving  
My feet are tied  
My eyes are closing  
My mouth is wide  
I will let you touch me  
If you want to touch me

1012,Eurythmics,Chelsea Lovers,"When he found her  
He stayed down there  
With his velvet pills  
And her purple hair  
In a room so dark  
They could barely crawl  
With orange posters  
On Victorian walls  
It was Saturday night  
And he felt like death  
She just wanted to be loved  
Like anybody else  
Saturday night  
And the clock never stopped  
She felt like a loser  
On top or the pops  
The Chelsea lovers  
With guillotine lips  
Mascara egos  
Doing a magazine strip  
Chelsea lovers  
In a vicious town  
With lipstick futures  
Like a couple of clowns  
Strange creatures  
In the eider down  
Teenage oblivion  
Waiting to be crowned  
Holes in the mattress  
Where these beasts have lain  
Awake until morning  
With ice in their veins  
Facing each other  
Their eyes never met  
He just wanted to be straight  
It never happened to him yet  
Both of them laughing  
But they can't understand  
What it is about friendship  
Makes you hold your own hand  
The Chelsea lovers  
Oh how they can talk  
With their tongues connected  
And their skin like chalk  
Chelsea lovers  
They're joined at the hip  
With the power of madness  
At their fingertips  
Chelsea lovers  
With their limbs entwined  
Making moon sized promises  
From their molecule minds  
Stardust lovers  
In a Ziggy cartoon  
Two solemn lovers  
In a Chelsea room.

1013,Eurythmics,Cold,"Come to me  
Do and be done with me  
(Cold cold cold)  
Don't I exist for you  
Don't I still live for you  
(Cold cold cold)  
Everything I possess  
Given with tenderness  
Wrapped in a ribbon of glass  
Time it may take us but God only knows  
How I've paid for those things in the past  
Dying is easy it's living that scares me to death  
I could be so content hearing the sound of your breath  
Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight  
That falls from the heavenly skies  
Catch me and let me dive under  
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes  
I want to be with you baby  
Slip me inside of your heart  
Don't I belong to you baby  
Don't you know that nothing can tear us apart  
Come on now come on now come on now  
Telling you that  
I loved you right from the start...  
But the more I want you the less I get  
Ain't that just the way things are...  
  
Winter has frozen us  
Let love take hold of us  
(Cold cold cold)  
Now we are shivering  
Blue ice is glittering  
(Cold cold cold)  
Cold is the colour of crystal the snowlight  
That falls from the heavenly skies  
Catch me and let me dive under  
For I want to swim in the pools of your eyes

Through obstacles and icicles, keeping my mind on it's lead  
Keeping it warm, with chemicals and therapy  
Turn it on take me over crazy sister  
Digging a hole in your heart  
Watching you breathe, punishment and oxygen  
Letting my mind off it's lead  
I watched it disappear, to somewhere dark and reassuring  
Turn it on (can you believe it)  
Take me over (it's psychomazingly true)  
Turn it on crazy sister  
And when I feel it (it's psychomazing it's you)  
Staying at home. Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen, being a god  
Staying at home, screwing it in  
Fucking the screen, being a god  
Turn it on (can you feel it)

1016,Eurythmics,Crown Of Madness,"My suit is mad. Of human hair  
My shoes are made of skin  
My shirt is made of vaseline  
From my knees up to my chin  
My jewellery is obscene  
But most of all it's fake  
My hat is made of solid gold  
It's the role I rightfully take  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Yeah a new creation  
I'm wearing my crown of madness  
Don't ask me to be faithful  
Don't ask me to be good

"
1017,Eurythmics,Diamond Avenue,"I saw a hundred men laughing only two understanding  
A wheel that was spinning for good and for evil  
There was a church bell ringing but nobody listening  
Except the beggars in the doorways of designer perfection  
There was a thin man collecting for a government problem  
He spent a long time waiting with that look of disapproval  
There was icicles forming in the agency windows but nothing for sale there  
Only dreamtime oblivion  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
And there's a tightrop marriage between the doctor and the junkie  
In daylight it's perfect but at night time it's frightening  
The hospital was moved so the hotel could profit  
But nobody stayed up there to curse it or to mock it  
As hi-fi condition arranged for my transport  
But there's nothing to hear except the sound of bloody progress  
The buildings are blushing from the interest they're earning  
But the tables and the chairs on the bombsites are burning  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah - The mysery well it brings you down like a recurring dream  
Ah - here on the diamond avenue (on the diamond avenue)  
Let's have a look, what do you see  
I saw Thatcher and Murdoch those twins of confusing  
Pay Saatchi and Saatchi to keep up their little illusion  
I saw pepsi and my hero both digging a goldmine  
It's funny how money can make you deaf as well as blind  
Ah - the mysteries that are discussed in the beds of the kings and queens  
Ah. The misery well it brings you down in a recurring dream  
Here on the diamond avenue  
Here on the diamond avenue  
Here on the diamond avenue

Yea, oh yea, yea  
Do you want to break-up?  
  
I've got a heavy heart  
Got heart filled full of lead.  
Pocket full of heartache  
(car crash in my head).  
I've got a steady hand  
Gonna lead me to my home.  
Take me up to heaven  
(heaven's where I'm goin')  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've seen trouble  
I looked right up to it's face  
Never tried to turn away.  
And I've been sad  
I've been overjoyed  
So let me disembrace you now  
My little trouble boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You took me to the ocean  
Dropped me like a stone.  
Took me to the deep blue ocean.  
I don't wanna stay there baby  
I don't wanna swim alone

1019,Eurythmics,Don't Ask Me Why,"Miracle of miracles  
Look what the night dragged in  
It's a pocket full of misery  
And trouble on the wind  
You spoiled the best years  
Of your life  
You took them all in vain  
Now you think that you're forgiven  
But you can't be born again  
  
And you say  
Why?  
You say why?  
You say why?  
Don't ask me why  
  
I don't love you anymore  
I don't think I ever did  
And if you ever had  
Any kind of love for me  
You kept it all so well hid  
  
Promises sweet promises  
You kept them from your mind  
Like all the lost forgotten things  
You never seemed to find  
Like all the disappointments  
You displayed upon your shelf  
Now you've got no one to turn to  
You've got no-one but yourself  
  
And you say  
Why?

There's a mess in the kitchen

Always a quick reply  
The mood the afternoon  
Another change of light  
There's nothing like an English  
Summer  
The telephone is good  
So wonderful and true

I know you live in isolation  
So you don't have to pretend  
That you could live alone forever  
And be your own best friend  
Here comes the writing on the wall  
And it looks so strange  
Like a primitive sign  
Don't you ever feel that you're so small  
Like a grain of sand in a bottle or wine  
Don't wait so long  
You know I'll always love you  
Don't wait so long  
You know I'll always love you

1023,Eurythmics,Fools Paradise,"Life  
It flicked like a dying flame  
Then before my very eyes you came  
And entered our world  
And you were born a king  
It's too late  
Welcome to paradise  
It's too late  
Yes you were born a king  
It's loo late  
Welcome to paradise  
It's too late  
Life  
A million things for you to learn  
But one by one those pages turn  
Like history itself  
But you were born a king  
Your pale blue eyes and velvet skin  
Fingertips and sideways grin  
No photograph or microphone  
Could capture your elusive tone  
No waterfall or running stream  
Could be so pure as your daydream  
No china doll or crystal sphere  
Comes close to you, my child so dear  
In you I have a glimpse of faith  
A love affair with outer space  
A foothold on a mountain top  
A passion there that never stops  
No magazines radio or late night  
Tv monster show  
Could entertain me more than you  
I want you to know  
That you were born a king  
Welcome to paradise  
Yes you were born a king  
Welcome to paradise

1024,Eurythmics,Forever,"Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
When we were young with time to waste  
Everything was clear and good  
Thought we could live for a thousand years  
But yesterday is done and tomorrow's yet to come  
You'll never know  
Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Forever  
And I remember when we were fools  
Everything was me and you  
Thought we were kings with time to kill  
But yesterday is done and tomorrow's yet to come  
You live and learn  
Some people never take the time to try  
The way you live's the way you die  
The stuff of life's in short supply  
And if it sometimes hits you strong  
Remembering that things go wrong  
The song of life is just a song  
And everything goes on and on  
Forever  
Now that you're gone  
Gone forever  
But the day goes on forever  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Forever

Greetings from the gutter  
I've been here since yesterday  
Sweet dreams in the gutter  
All the skeletons come out to play  
At times I feel so logical inside  
So just give me the keys  
And I'll drive myself back home

That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over

A little soft edged but bitter  
You're a star you don't talk to me  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over  
That's what you've got to do, when it's all over

1026,Eurythmics,Happy To Be Here,"I put all my eggs in the bacon slicer  
But now it's turned out fine.  
In fact it couldn't be nice  
A nice Jewish girl and a bottle of cider  
Seven days later I was a man of the world  
...... I thought  
I'll go and get a slice of pizza from the pizzeria  
Oh, and a coke  
Has anybody got the change of five quid  
  
I'm happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
And I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me and happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
But you'd had to have been there to be here  
With me  
  
I played a blinder against a gaggle of nuns  
I was all mouth and trousers they were fingers  
And thumbs had a lesson from the vicar on oral hygiene  
He was stitching my trousers, and staring at  
Christine she had three tickets to see Alfie at the Odeon  
""What's it all about Christine?""  
Free you mind  
Yeah... But what the...  
I'm happy to to be here  
So happy to be here

Unhappy with me

I really dig the clothes you wear  
I only wish you could be my baby

Do you think we could have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
  
Two weeks in Electric Lady Land  
Two weeks and that's all for me  
I could be lucky and get off lightly  
With a broken nose and the third degree  
She said I really dig Disco music  
And if you want to be my baby  
We'd better talk about it  
Maybe then we could have an affair  
  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind too see  
  
I want to drive East Coast to West Coast  
Turn up my radio set myself free  
Don't want to talk about it  
You and me should have an affair

Maybe I'm just too blind to see  
Maybe your heart is made of stone  
Maybe I'm just too blind to see.

And I'm standing on ice  
When I say that I don't hear planes  
want to scream at walls  
I want to jump my chain

Take you higher  
Take you up to the place

Peace in your heart

1029,Eurythmics,Heaven And Earth,"The drunk mortician lurches  
Past the broken windowed churches  
He starts to laugh and cry  
At the same time  
What really makes him drink  
Is the time he has to think  
And he knows that there is  
Nowhere he can hide  
He's got people making speeches  
Hang around like leeches  
To drink that heady drug  
Of untold power  
Their arguments are quoted  
And the winner then is voted but  
The loser always has  
The finest hour...  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you...  
Doctors try to save them  
Priests don't know how to tell them  
There's nothing you can do but repent  
You might think that he's a hero  
But like Nixon Mao or Nero  
All you know is that they came... Then they went  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you

Like a statue in the sky  
Her arms are wicked, her legs are long  
When she moves, my brain screams out this song

Like a dog that begs for something sweet  
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?  
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

Comes up eager and shining  
And it likes to leave a scar before it goes.  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling

Nobody hurts me like you do.  
You cut into me like a poison dart.  
Creep into my sleep at night.  
Break into my dreams and tear them apart.  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling.  
  
Have you ever felt the sound of disappointment?  
It pounds in your head like hammer blows.  
Comes on gentle and smiling.  
And it likes to leave a scar  
Here it comes again no.  
Here comes that sinking feeling.

Lost your money in a parking lot  
It was funny but it's all you've got

And a very healthy overdose

Sleeping all night solo with the grateful dead

But she sure knew how to put out all the lights  
I once watched her walk right  
Through a plate glass window  
And never even look hack  
Now here I am talking about all her good points  
I never did think she had any bad  
Though friends told me she could be cruel  
And vicious  
At one time she was the best friend that I had  
And I hope she can hear  
I hope she feels good  
I hope she was the best or everything  
And I hope she feels like a million dollars  
And I hope she knows I was always honest  
Now Jerry was a main-line angel  
She never came home at night  
She slept where the wind would take her  
In her P. V. C thigh length boots  
Make-up black and solid  
Fingernails bitten by teeth so close  
To perfection only marred by  
Seven years of obvious fake prescriptions  
That were one way or making  
Sure that she never saw the daylight  
Before wearing her sunglasses over  
Breakfast with her Italian girlfriend  
In a post blitz kid stupor  
Saying ""How ya doin', Davy boy""  
You know you're such a trooper  
And I hope you feel good  
And I hope you feel like a million dollars  
And I hope you know that I was  
Always.... Honest

You can read my hand I've got no defence  
When you send your messages, whispered loud and clear  
I'm always touched by your presence dear

We could navigate together psychic frequencies  
Coming into contact with outer entities  
We could entertain each one with our theosophies

Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere

1042,Eurythmics,I've Got A Lover,"I've got a lover back in japan  
He's got tatooes

We can talk about the weather  
Is the weather fine?  
  
And I say break, break  
Break away those ties  
Break, break.

Up in outer space

Got another lover in timbuktu  
Got a name for him

When I don't call him he starts to cry  
I have to tell him stories just to pacify.  
  
Break, break...  
  
When the whole world descends on me  
I'll be waiting for you...

I was eloquent with rage  
Like honey from a poisoned cup  
I flowed from stage to stage.

But I don't think I can make it fit  
And who would guess it would come to this  
When I've tried everything

The endless noise sounding in my brain  
Who would've thought that you could feel such pain  
When you've tried everything  
  
Yea, you're a loser now  
Yea, you're a loser now

But I'm burning hot

1049,Eurythmics,Kinky Sweetheart,"Staying at home  
Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen  
Being a god  
I thought about it in the Galleria  
Liquid crystal like a man ray tear  
A shiny surface, velveteen queer  
Bailey contrast, a Lucas idea  
I've seen your set up and it's perfect in form  
Let's call somebody to connect both our arms  
You bring the orange I'll bring the clock  
We'll pay the dream police to circle the block  
Staying al home  
Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen  
And being a god  
Slaying at home  
Plugging it in  
Lucking the screen  
And being a god

1050,Eurythmics,Legend In My Living Room,"When I was just seventeen I ran away from home  
To be with all the pretty people  
To be on my own  
Bright lights and trains and bedsit stains  
And pavements paved with gold  
And I believed in everything that everybody told me  
Have mercy  
Have mercy on me  
I found myself in a lonely place with a suitcase full of dreams  
And I soon grew up to realise what living in the doghouse means  
But everyday I told myself good things would happen soon  
'Cause I knew that was going to be a legend in my living room  
Have mercy  
Have mercy on me  
(Welcome to this perfect world)  
Now everyday on a dead street is where I spend my time  
The dust has been collecting on the corners of my mind  
But I've she'd my tears in bitter drops until the thorn trees bloomed  
To take the spiky fruit to crown myself the Queen of doom  
Have mercy  
Have mercy

1051,Eurythmics,Love Song For A Vampire,"Come into these arms again  
And lay your body down  
The rhythm of this trembling heart  
Is beating like a drum  
It beats for you  
It bleeds for you  
It knows not how it sounds  
For it is the drum of drums  
It is the song of songs  
  
Once I had the rarest rose  
That ever deigned to bloom  
Cruel winter chilled the bud  
And stole my flower too soon  
Oh loneliness, Oh hopelessness  
To search the ends of time  
For there is in all the world  
No greater love than mine  
  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
Still falls the rain  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
Still falls the night  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
Be mine forever  
Love oh love oh love oh love...  
  
Let me be the only one  
To keep you from the cold  
Now the floor of heaven's laid  
With stars of brightest gold  
They shine for you, they shine for you  
They burn for all to see  
Come into these arms again  
And set this spirit free

1052,Eurythmics,Missionary Man,"Well I was born an original sinner.  
I was borne from original sin.  
And if I had a dollar bill  
For all the things I've done  
There'd be a mountain of money  
Piled up to my chin  
  
My mother told me good  
My mother told me strong.  
She said ""Be true to yourself  
And you can't go wrong.""  
""But there's just one thing  
That you must understand.""  
""You can fool with your brother  
But don't mess with a missionary man.""  
  
Don't mess with a missionary man.  
Don't mess with a missionary man.  
  
Well the missionary man  
He's got god on his side.  
He's got the saints and apostles  
Backin' up from behind.  
Black eyed looks from those bible books.  
He's a man with a mission  
Got a serious mind.  
There was a woman in the jungle  
And a monkey on a tree.  
The missionary man he was followin' me.  
He said ""Stop what you're doing.""  
""Get down upon your knees.""  
""I've a message for you that you better believe.""

1054,Eurythmics,My Place,"My place  
Some people say it's  
Bad taste  
One thing that I can see  
They take themselves  
Too seriously  
My shoes  
They once were worn by  
Howard Hugues  
But I know  
I'm never gonna walk  
That way  
  
That's why I need you  
I need you

In any other world  
No barbarella kiss  
Can make me feel like this  
I need you  
  
Tell me your stars  
I'll tell you what your chances are  
One thing that I can see  
You take yourself too seriously  
My place  
It might as well be outer space  
But I know it's always gonna be that way  
  
That's why I want you  
I want you  
There is no other chance  
No other circumstance  
No way to change the past  
Now is here to last  
I want you  
  
Have you ever been stood in the middle of the street  
With a mindful of doubt and the world at your feet  
When your heads full of rain on a bright sunny day  
And the words in your head are like cold lumps of clay  
Never feeling home was a place you belong  
So you get lost in the words of a Bob Dylan song  
Staying up all night with a royal marine  
Trying to learn the chords to Moonage Daydream  
  
That's why I need you  
And I want you  
There is no other girl  
In any other world  
No way to chage the past  
Now you're here at last  
And I need you ......

Oh, where did I go wrong?  
My true love has found himself alone  
And he's sorry for it all  
And for the hurt, we've done  
And I've given more than I can take  
Fallen for the same mistake  
Promises were made to break  
What will save us now?  
And I don't want to remember  
And I don't want to remember  
My true love is a saccharine kind of pill  
That tastes too sweet for words  
And cannot be fulfilled  
My true love is a dangerous China cup  
With all the broken pieces  
That cannot be picked up  
Now all the colors left to run  
All the dreams have been undone  
Love has left me standing here  
Raging at the sun  
And I don't want to remember  
And I don't want to remember

I like to take it when I can  
I need to play with the ones I hate  
I like to see them suffer  
  
It has to be dangerous  
It has to be refined  
It has to be skill full  
You need to take your time  
  
She said I take care  
Of my resources  
You never know  
When you might need them

To relieve this mess I'm in  
'Cause when depression starts to win  
I need to be right by your side  
  
No one seems to touch me  
In the way you do  
Nothing seems to hurt me  
When I'm close to you  
I'm so full of desire  
When you set my head on fire  
I need to be right by your side  
  
Every single one of us needs  
Love, love, love  
Everybody needs to give and receive love  
Every single day can drag us  
Down, down, down  
But there's nothing left to fear  
When love gets into town  
  
I'm so full of desire  
When you set my head on fire  
I need to be right by your side

At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along

Practise mudslinging  
And when things get scary  
We'll say three hail marys  
Drink till the morning then  
Off with the fairies  
  
I'll meet you at the royal infirmary

From the vacant chair  
Looking in the mirror  
While she's combing her hair  
Wipes the dust from a cup  
While she's cleaning up  
Wonders very slightly  
What she's doing there  
A simple reflection  
Can be too revealing  
Years are for counting  
Years are for stealing  
She's a mathematician  
Calculator  
Counting daily  
Counting forever  
Cold clean glass and a razor blade  
Fly on the table and a passing car  
Closes the curtain to keep in the shade  
Closes her head and now she's counting down  
Dust is collecting  
But she doesn't notice  
Counting for ever  
She's a calculator  
No-one can see her  
She's invisible now  
No-one can see her  
And the dust is collecting

That behind every great man there had to be a great woman.  
But in these times of change you know that it's no longer true  
  
So we're comin' out of the kitchen  
  
'Cause there's something we forgot to say to you

Sisters are doin' it for themselves  
  
Standin' on their own two feet an ringin' on their own bells.  
Sisters are doin' it for themselves.

Can you see there's a woman right next to you.  
We say: Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Dropped my flowers in the rain  
And got carried away  
The tide was coming in  
I could have been sad  
I could have been amused  
But I was just in pieces  
It was then that I knew  
The tide was coming in  
Aaahh this pattern on the back of my hand  
It makes a joke of me and the veins are like  
Rivers in sand running out to sea  
Nobody slept on the night of the crash  
We were all covered in devil grey ash  
The tide was coming in  
I could have been dead  
I could have been underground  
But somebody decided I should stick around  
The tide was coming in  
Aaahh I know I'm just killing time  
But time is killing me  
My eyes are witness to this crime and looking out to sea

When I could die here in your arms  
Even if the stars have made us blind  
We're blind we're blind  
So blind in love  
Sweet darling  
Don't you know that we're no different to anyone  
We stumble  
We falter

Into a pool of silver water  
And we were standing in a thunder cloud  
Dark as your hair

I always make the mistake of being myself  
  
I'd like to make a friend  
Without any flaws  
Who takes me for what I am

Who fell for a funny boy  
They built a funny house and made some funny kids  
And christened it the house of holy joy  
  
If forever meant forever that was the place  
Or so she told her friends  
But the city took her lovers to another world  
Left her waiting for the flowers to bloom again  
  
And she laughed  
And she cried  
She damn near died  
On the day it rained forever  
  
She walked around the garden with an empty mind  
Feeling tired and worn  
Not exactly sure what she was meant to find  
Heaven knows maybe a rose without a thorn  
  
She laughed  
She cried  
She damn near died  
On the day it rained forever

The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you

Your face was hollow to the bone  
You were talking to St. John about a revolution  
That was the kind of trip you're on total destruction  
Yeah you'll be turning in your grave  
It's just no way to behave  
The devil's just been using you  
[Bridge:] after instrumental  
Yeah you'll be shivering inside  
When you realise  
The devil's just been using you  
The devil's just been using you (repeat)

Peace will never come into your life if you believe the  
Words he whispers in your mind it's just a piece of  
Conciousness that hangs around to let us know that  
Love is waiting to embrace us all

Can hurt the most ferociously.

Oh I'll show you something good.  
If you open your heart  
You can make a start  
When your crumbling world falls apart.

Keeps this stupid brain on mine alive  
  
You float around inside my head  
Going from one extreme to the other  
But words like these should go unsaid  
So I'll keep y big mouth shut forever  
  
And  
The thought of you  
Keeps the gates of heaven open wide  
The thought of you  
Keeps this stupid brain of mine alive

Make the bells of hell go ting a ling a ling

To take my attention  
And when you touch my skin  
I smell disaster  
  
Step away, walk away  
All I want is the real thing  
(nothing but the real thing)

Asleep in the houses  
So alone,  
Looking inside herself  
She breaks the glass  
Turns her head backwards  
She's fallen down again

And suddenly my heart goes boom  
It's an orchestra of angels  
And they're playing with my heart

No one on earth could feel like this  
I'm thrown and overflown with bliss  
There must be an angel  
Playing with my heart  
  
And when I think that I'm alone  
It seems there's more of us at home  
It's a multitude of angels  
And they're playing with my heart  
  
I must be hallucinating  
Watching angels celebrating  
Could this be reactivating  
All my senses dislocating  
This must be a strange deception  
By celestial intervention  
Leavin' me the recollection  
Of your heavenly connection

Outside it was raining and I was feeling insecure  
Sooner or later you got to face the fact  
This world is shattered and it's too full of cracks to fill in  
So we just give in on a Thursday afternoon...  
In this little town where the traffic moves slow in the pouring rain  
I want to take you there where the four winds blow  
To be born again  
I was out there with the Beatles and the Cranks  
Trying to make some money and not to fall into the ranks of suburbia  
With Richard Toomey a visionary ghost...  
Sooner or later we make the same mistakes  
Our pockets are all empty and our spirit starts to break  
Just uke a baby left in the car park on a foggy new years eve...  
In this little town where winter begins  
In the summertime (summertime)  
I want to take you there  
Wash away our sins  
And be born again  
I was talking to some friends of mine trying to make some sense  
After drinking a case of wine from Yugoslavia but just before  
Breakfast we all started to agree... (wich was very unusual for us)  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In the pouring rain  
I want to take you there  
To be born again  
In this little town  
In the summertime  
I want to take you there  
And be born again  
Born again...

1092,Eurythmics,Thorn In My Side,"Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you ever were.  
A bundle of lies.  
You know that's all that it was worth  
I should have known better  
But I trusted you at first.  
I should have known better  
But I got what I deserved  
  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
  
Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you'll ever be.  
So don't think you know better  
'Cause that's what you mean to me  
I was feeling complicated.  
I was feeling low.  
Now everytime I think of you  
I shiver to the bone

1093,Eurythmics,Walk Into The Wind,"You have to learn to love my loving  
Turn around and say you care  
You have to learn to give by giving  
Give me a beatnik love affair  
We'll watch the shooting stars go crazy  
So what d'ya say, a definite maybe  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Let's walk into the wind  
You have to learn to touch by touching  
  
Touch me, touch me if you dare  
We've reached the end of the beginning  
In this beatnik love affair  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Let's walk into the wind  
Before you taste another tear my love  
I know a place where rainbows end  
The kingdom of the final kiss is but a breath away  
Here come those shooting stars again  
  
Should we walk into the wind  
Maybe fall when autumn falls  
Let's walk into the wind

1094,Eurythmics,Walking On Broken Glass,"You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew  
But I don't care for sugar honey if I can't have you  
Since you've abandoned me  
My whole life has crashed  
Won't you pick the pieces up  
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken glass  
The sun's still shining in the big blue sky  
But it don't mean nothing to me  
Oh let the rain come down  
Let the wind blow through me  
I'm living in an empty room  
With all the windows smashed  
And I've got so little left to lose  
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken glass  
And if you're trying to cut me down  
You know that I might bleed  
Cause if you're trying to cut me down  
I know that you'll succeed  
And if you want to hurt me  
There's nothing left to fear  
Cause if you want to hurt me  
You're doing really well my dear  
Now everyone of us was made to suffer  
Everyone of us was made to weep  
But we've been hurting one another  
And now the pain has cut too deep...  
So take me from the wreckage  
Save me from the blast  
Lift me up and take me back  
Don't let me keep on walking...  
Walking on broken glass  
Walking on walking on broken

1095,Eurythmics,Was It Just Another Love Affair?,"You don't call me anymore  
But don't you think that I don't care  
I check the numbers every night  
Just to see if you are there  
Was it just another love affair?  
Was it just another love affair? Ooh  
My clock goes ticking through the night  
Counting the seconds I don't sleep  
I wish that I could turn back time  
But some things were never meant to keep  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, another love affair)  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
Without you  
(Oh)  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, will never be the same  
Will never be the same, never be the same  
And remember how we once were  
When you held me so closely  
We were breathing in the dark light  
There was no more pain  
One love, one heart, one soul together, ooh  
Was it just another love affair?  
(Was it just a love affair)  
(Another love affair, love affair, love affair)  
Was it just another love affair?

1097,Eurythmics,When Tomorrow Comes,"Underneath your dreamlit eyes  
Shades of sleep have driven you away.  
The moon is pale outside  
And you are far from here.  
  
Breathing shifts your careless head  
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives.  
Another day, another night  
Has taken you again my dear.  
  
And you know that I'm gonna be the one  
Who'll be there  
When you need someone to depend upon  
When tomorrow comes  
When tomorrow comes  
  
Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea  
Wait till tomorrow comes, yea yea  
Last night while you were  
Lying in my arms  
  
And I was wondering where you were  
You know you looked just like a baby  
Fast asleep in this dangerous world.  
Every star was shining brightly  
Just like a million years before.  
  
And we were feeling very small  
Underneath the universe.  
  
And you know that I'm gonna be the one  
Who'll be there when you need  
Someone to depend upon  
When tomorrow comes  
When tomorrow comes

Love was missing in the whole wide world

1099,Eurythmics,Why,"How many times do I have to try to tell you  
That I'm sorry for the things I've done  
But when I start to try to tell you  
That's when you have to tell me  
Hey...this kind of trouble's only just begun  
I tell myself too many times  
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut  
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words  
That keep on falling from your mouth  
Falling from your mouth  
Falling from your mouth  
Tell me  
Why  
Why  
I may be mad  
I may be blind  
I may be viciously unkind  
But I can still read what you're thinking  
And I've heard is said too many times  
That you're better off  
Besides...  
Why can't you see this boat is sinking  
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)  
Let's go down to the water's edge  
And we can cast away those doubts  
Some things are better left unsaid  
But they still turn me inside out  
Turning inside out turning inside out Tell me...  
Why  
Tell me...  
Why  
This is the book I never read  
These are the words I never said  
This is the path I'll never tread  
These are the dreams I'll dream instead  
This is the joy that's seldom spread  
These are the tears...  
The tears we shed  
This is the fear  
This is the dread  
These are the contents of my head  
And these are the years that we have spent  
And this is what they represent  
And this is how I feel  
Do you know how I feel?  
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel  
I don't think you know how I feel  
I don't think you know how I feel  
You don't know what I feel

In the lane snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
Here to stay is the new bird  
He sings a love song as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No, man  
But you can do the job when you're in town""  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made

Walking in a winter wonderland, hand in hand  
We'll go walking, walking in a winter wonderland

Love is a temple  
Love is a shrine  
Buy some love at the five and dime  
A little bit of love  
From the counter store  
Get it on credit if you need some more.  
I'll the figure of your disgrace  
A criss cross pattern upon your face  
A woman's just too tired to think  
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink.  
  
I wish I was invisible  
So I could climb through the telephone  
When it hurts my ear  
And it hurts my brain  
And it makes me feel too much  
Too much too much too much.  
Don't cut me down  
When I'm talking to you  
'Cause I'm much too tall  
To feel that small.  
  
Love is a temple  
Love is a shrine  
Love is pure  
And love is blind  
Love is a religious sign  
I'm gonna leave this love behind.  
Love is hot and love is cold  
I've been bought and I've been sold  
Love is rock and love is roll  
I just want someone to hold.

The way you feel  
The way we make each other feel  
You celebrate  
And cut a cake  
Yes you couldn't wait  
No you couldn't wait  
But you never thought about the way I'd feel  
The way you made somebody feel  
Do you believe in all you hear  
Your husband's sick  
Your sister's queer  
Your mouth is full of shaky teeth  
From dreams that make you disbelieve  
That all I've ever said and done was  
Wish you well and have some fun  
Have some fun

Things only you could know  
If I had one wish  
I'd wish to talk with you  
Nothing you can feel  
Can feel as cold as this

I'll say goodbye forever

If God is all they say  
I can't believe in such things.  
I suppose  
Some games are hard to lose  
But you don't have to play 'cause  
I can feel  
A child with the ghost here

This impossible room  
I still believe  
That great American smile  
  
Nothing's ever right  
Nothing's ever wrong  
But nothing's ever quite like  
The stories and songs (nothing's ever)  
  
Heroes always bleed

That great American smile

Corridor empty  
Time to call in the stage

In the dead of night  
  
I'll be your demon  
Shadow man  
I'll be your one confession  
  
And if I can  
I'll be your nightmare  
And scream for you  
I'll be your one possession  
If you want me to  
  
I'll be your secret  
Memory  
I'll be your exhibition of atrocity

Sold my soul

Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul  
Don't pray for my soul

Shout 'Hallelujah'  
Lift up their eyes while they pray  
  
When children kill children  
Don't it make them wonder?  
Don't it make them question their faith?

Here we are  
How old are you  
It's just a job to me  
  
Here the ladies always ring twice  
Thought you'd slip away tonight with me  
In a subway I called 'you'  
  
Hello you no more this talk of  
'My boys will be yours'  
  
No more 'I'  
This conversation drains  
My patience dry.  
  
Here the business always rings twice  
No relaxing for the boys tonight  
In a subway I called 'you'  
  
Here the tension always slows twice  
Shed one tear it's just routine for now  
In a subway I called 'you'

If you asked me to  
I would walk out of heaven  
Just to be with you  
  
This is absolute  
This is absolution  
  
I would be your disciple  
And I'd worship you  
Burn the prophets of reason  
Light the sky for you  
Kill the children of Eden  
If you want me to  
Close the dead eyes of God  
If they offended you  
  
This is absolute  
This is absolution

1111,Gary Numan,All Across The Nation,"Somewhere in the city  
There's a struggle going on  
Someones making money  
Someones doing wrong  
Everybody searching for a little piece of gold  
(power play? )(fix a face? ) never grow old  
Its a shame  
Whos gonna take control?  
Its a game they play  
Whos gonna save your soul?  
And they're never gonna stop  
Till they reach the top  
All across the nation  
Fever takes control  
Money is temptation  
Money saves your soul  
One thing I can tell you  
Of this there is no doubt  
The rich man needs his comfort  
And the poor man does without  
Everybody loves somebody  
All around the world  
But everybody knows  
Its the rich man gets the girl  
-chorus-  
Look at all the little people  
(cowering? ) from the rain  
Standing at the bus stop  
Dreaming bout spain  
Here comes the rich man  
Driving his car  
When he was poor he was sure  
He was gonna go far

1112,Gary Numan,An Alien Cure,"So I wandered like Jesus  
Like an alien cure  
Searching for my disciples  
Dispossessed and alone.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your corruption.  
I took a virgin like Mary  
And said ""I give you The One""  
I confessed to desire  
And watched the world come undone.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your obsession.  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To Heaven.  
Your Heaven.  
So I moved like a rumour  
Like a glorious lie  
And I walked into Heaven  
Into dead paradise.  

"
1113,Gary Numan,Ancients,"All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know...  
You're not with me.  
Some can shine,  
Some can fly,  
Some are glorious,  
Some are ancient.  
Some are wise,  
Some are strong,  
Some are everything  
You could dream of.  
Some are clouds,  
Some are rain,  
Float like angel wings  
On an ocean.  
Some can sing  
Songs of Gods,  
Words so beautiful  
They fall like raindrops.  
Fall like raindrops.  
Fall like raindrops.  
But none are like me,  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know is you're not with me.  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know is you're not with me.  
Some will cry,  
Cry for you,  
Take your pain away  
When you're sleeping.  
Some will die,  
In your name,  
Give their soul to you  
For safe keeping.  
All I know is you're not with me,  
Like me.  
All I know...  
All I know is that you're not with me,  
Like me. (x3)  
All I know is that you're not with me.  
You're not with me. (x4)  
  

"
1114,Gary Numan,Are 'friends' Electric?,"It's cold outside  
And the paint's peeling off of my walls  
There's a man outside  
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette  
  
Now the light fades out  
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this  
There's a knock on the door  
And just for a second I thought I remembered you  
  
So now I'm alone  
Now I can think for myself  
About little deals  
And issues  
And things that I just don't understand  
A white lie that night  
Or a sly touch at times  
I don't think it meant anything to you  
  
So I open the door  
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway  
Please sit down  
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed  
  
You know I hate to ask  
But, are 'friends' electric?  
Only mine's broke down  
And now I've no one to love  
  
So I find out your reasons  
For the phone calls and smiles  
And it hurts  
And I'm lonely  
And I should never have tried  
And I missed you tonight  
It must be time to leave  
You see it meant everything to me

"
1115,Gary Numan,Call Out The Dogs,"Here am I  
Like a target in flesh  
One more time  
For you to call out the dogs  
Passengers  
With a ticket to burn and burn and burn  
You will learn  
I'm still waiting for you you know  
  
I'm a slogan, an old story,  
A disease, never again  
I don't like this, new anger,  
These young boys, just make me laugh  
This picture, I'm so nervous,  
The DJ, says 'who are you?'  
Look at me, I'm shaking,  
I don't know if I can move  
  
I don't need  
This attention again  
I've lost time  
I could lose everything  
You will learn  
That you've nowhere to go so go

"
1116,Gary Numan,Change Your Mind,"Why don't you ever listen?  
It's you I'm talking to  
This time it's your decision  
We're into something new  
I know that I'm sinking  
Oh any fool can see  
Time that I was thinking  
Of no-one else but me  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain  
  
Why can't you reconsider  
Listen if you care  
Take familiar giver  
Reject me if you dare  
Give me what I'm asking  
And save it all for me  
Love that's everlasting  
That's how it's meant to be  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain  
  
Change your mind  
Nothing ever stays the same  
Change your mind  
No-one ever plays the game game game  
Change your mind  
Give up what you can't defend  
Change your mind  
Think it up and start again 'gain 'gain

"
1117,Gary Numan,Check It,"Something isn't right  
I get the feeling I'm not driving  
Something hasn't quite  
Taken over but it's trying  
  
Check it, check it  
  
The question now is time  
The hours pass so slowly  
I know we're moving out of line  
But that's the risk you're taking with me  
  
I flicker like an old film - Black white  
I'm losing track of what's real - I know  
My sense of timing's not quite - OK  
Maybe I'll stay tonight - So so  
  
Fadeout, as in lose  
My character is shrapnel  
Broken by the views  
Of men who claim to know all  
(There is to know)  
  
Something isn't right  
I get the feeling I am no-one  
Something hasn't quite  
Stopped me from being someone  
  
Nothing in the mirror - Check it  
No photo by my bedside - Check it  
My self control is missing - Check it  
I'll leave with your permission - Check it  

"
1118,Gary Numan,Confession,"Listen up  
This is confession  
This machine motion is sure to break my heart  
Listen up  
This is confession  
Recorded music sticks in the throat of God.  
I O you, you don't own me  
I O you, you don't own me  
Party time, one mor night, everybody's affected  
Listen up  
This is confession  
You are a poison that flows into my veins.  
Listen up  
This is confession  
I've never been so scared of letting you down.  
You know me, so come closer  
You know me, so come closer  
Party time, one more town, everybody's affected.  
I know you, you don't need me  
I know you, you don't need me  
Party time, one more girl, everybody's affected  
Listen up  
This is confession  
They tell me heaven just has to be somewhere  
Listen up  
This is confession  
I'd lie to God if I could make him believe.  
You owe me, and I need you  
You owe me, and I need you  
Party time, one more game, everybody's affected  
This is my confession  
This is my confession  
Party time, one more lie, everybody's affected  

"
1119,Gary Numan,Crash,"Don't things change  
Don't we all  
What's it like to crash?  
The driver  
  
Nothing more to prove  
So please just send in the machines  
We know little of celebrations  
And how things are with you  
You're hung up on time  
You're hung up on age  
Now there's me  
Now there's me  
What is it like to  
Crash? The driver  
  
You drink to rumors and talk  
About someone new in your bed  
There is no game to win so  
Get out as fast as you can  
  
Hung up on 'the time'  
Hung up on 'my age'  
You don't know  
You don't know  
What it's like to  
Crash? The driver

"
1120,Gary Numan,Crazier,"The more I take a look inside, the more I'm fried  
The more I understand the ride, the more I slide  
The more you put me back in line, the more I tried  
The more you looked into my eyes, the more you lied  
I come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
The more I disregard the signs, the more I fly  
The more I walk across the lines, the more I glide  
You come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
You come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
  

"
1121,Gary Numan,Creatures,"I need it  
The sex skin habit  
You could just crawl out  
And forget I'm here  
  
I need it  
Love and something  
I'd just as soon forget  
So keep it out the papers  
  
I need it  
The sex musicians  
I'll show you something  
While the boys beat time  
  
I need it  
And she's still waiting  
We like to wake up  
In a strange bed romance  
  
One more time for me  
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies  
Please one more time for me  
You are the young things fed on garbage and lies  
I'm talking far too much about my shame  
  
I need it  
Creatures calling  
I'll tear my heart out  
But I need some more  
  
I need it  
I'm under pressure  
I don't remember  
If her story's true

"
1122,Gary Numan,Critics,"You could say I'm pretentious  
You could say I'm the nazz  
You could hail me as the new king of it all  
You could say I'm nothing new  
You could speak well of me  
You could say it's already been done before  
  
What will you make of my lines  
What will you think I've said  
What hidden secrets will you say are in my head  
  
I feel you waiting for me  
Waiting to dig my grave  
I'm growing scared of everything you could say  
  
Look in my eyes  
There's no surprise at all  
Critical mind  
What will you find to say  
  
Old faces in my wardrobe  
So many I've not seen  
Memories to look back on people I've been  
Dead love on faded carpets  
Nostalgia grows with time  
I see your face in mirrors shadowing mine  
I see your dirty finger  
Marks are still on my wall  
I can recall the time we tried it that way  
In dingy hotel backrooms  
Where paint cracks like your face  
I must admit I have acquired the taste (?)  
  
Stab my arm  
With your synthetic feelings  
You amaze me  
I crave for you  
  
You could say I'm pretentious  
You could say I'm the nazz  
You could hail me as the new king of it all  
  

"
1123,Gary Numan,Cry,"I don't cry  
Or forget  
I'll cut my picture on your heart  
No names  
You've got one more game to lose  
  
I was young  
I was clean  
But now my soul eats me alive  
I was kind  
Now I'm your first big mistake  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
She sold pain  
She sold mine  
She sold my secret to the man  
She sold lies  
And so now I break the word  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
Tear up my picture  
Tear up my face  
You'll tear up your feelings but the memory's quite safe  
  
Look back in anger  
Look back and cry  
Look up my number if you want to know why  
  
Don't leave  
What'ya gonna do?  
Are you gonna break down and cry?  
  
Same need  
Same cure  
I'll whisper words to ease your shame  
Play time  
I've got one more trick for you  
  
I don't pray  
Wrong man  
I don't look for love that I don't need  
Wrong place  
You've got one more chance to leave  
  

"
1124,Gary Numan,Cry Clock Said,"Why cry now  
It's over  
Feelings change  
How are you  
How am I  
Cry, the clock said.  
  
I know little of romance  
And these little tract houses  
I know even less of you  
And if you should ever think of me  
Maybe as a game you lost  
Well someone I know lost the whole damn world  
No more this talk of they're out to get me  
Just slide out of Sydney and I can never go back  
How could I be surprised  
How could I even believe  
Cry, the clock said  
I'll forget who you are  
I'll forget one of these days  
Cry, the clock said

"
1125,Gary Numan,Dance,"When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap your hands dance, dance  
  
Dance, everybody down with us just dance  
Wanna feel the groove then clap your hands  
They ask who's been blessed tonight, I am  
God's been good to me, never to be too late  
And continually he's great he's on time  
Even if I have to sit and wait  
  
Sitting in the corner reminiscing  
The course my life  
Has taken all my ups and all my downs  
But your mercy and grace brought me to this place  
  
When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap you hands dance, dance  
  
Trials and pain temptations reign  
I never see how I'm gone make it though on my own  
Not a chance, so I have to turn to you  
Then you come and rescue me once again and again  
So right now all I can do is give you praise  
  
It's alright, it's okay, come clap your hands  
Give him praise, give him praise  
Go ahead just stand up  
Come on shout and dance, give him praise  
  
When I think of what he's done  
I can dance, dance, dance all day, all night  
Come on stand, clap your hands, dance  

"
1126,Gary Numan,Dark,"I've been waiting here  
Waiting for faith  
And the word to fall.  
Now the darkness comes  
And I'll pray for  
The end of us all.  
  
Don't let the dark into me  
We killed the angels that warned us of you  
Don't let the dark into me  
We raised the tower of Babel for you  
Don't let the dark into me  
We let the children build temples for you  
Don't let the dark into me  
Don't let the vengeance of Heaven be you  
  
So pray to me, I'm the Lord's new disease,  
Look down into the face of God.  
Bow down and cry, I'm the black Messiah,  
The one true divinity.  
Kneel before my altar and drink the wine of slaughter,  
Who said I'd save anyone?  
So bleed for me, I need hostility  
To lead the faithful and the blind.  
  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the poison that feeds life to you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the demon that waits inside you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the ghost that reminds death of you  
Don't let the light shine on me  
I am the darkness that crawls into you

"
1127,Gary Numan,Dark Sunday,"You're like poison  
You smile at me  
Talk of love.  
'He' will forgive me  
If I confess.  
Your dark Sunday  
You lied to me  
And so I  
Replaced God  
With a picture of my car.  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  
I'm on the E kick  
So heaven's in my head  
I'm in Outland  
Shame on me.  
I want pictures  
People come, people go  
D'you think God  
Will forgive me soon?  
You won't like this  
You won't like this.  
Rip it up  
Rip it into pieces  
Rip it up  
Rip it for good.  
Touch me, touch me.  
He won't like this  
He won't like this  
'He' won't touch me  
I can't dance and I can't sing  
I'm not stone shape  
But time runs out.  
I don't like this  
All I see is cold and hard  
All I can do now  
Is break 'the word'  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  
'He' will love me?  
Well thank him  
For nothing.  
I need that like  
I need a disease.  
So pray for me.  
I don't mind  
I don't care.  
I've found love  
It's an American machine.  
I don't like this  
I don't like this.  

"
1128,Gary Numan,Dead Heaven,"Thought I was asleep  
Lost to dreams  
I was dying in a big machine  
Didn't think the voice that called me  
Could be real.  
  
Thought I woke up  
Lost my faith  
I was staring at the face of rage  
Didn't think I'd see the demon in ""His"" heart  
  
Thought I saw blood  
Turn to wine  
A vision from the angel wars  
Didn't think I'd find the savior in the dark  
  
Thought I saw a light  
Tear the storm  
Showing me the way to God  
Didn't know that Heaven died and went to Hell  
  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed are shadows and pain  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed is death in ""His"" name  
  
Thought I saw rain  
Black and cold  
Falling on a child's grave  
Thought I saw an angel laugh and piss on it  
  
Thought I saw a dance  
Strange and cruel  
Swaying to the screams of men  
Thought I saw the Lord's disciples laugh at that  
  
Thought I saw love  
Sacrificed  
Mary under three wise men  
Thought I saw the Virgin look at me and cry  
  
Thought I saw a cross  
And Jesus dead  
Burning in the midnight sky  
Thought I saw God dancing in the flames  
  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is shadows and pain  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is death in ""His"" name  
  
""Do you confess?""  
""Cleanse your sin""  
""Do you believe in the word of God?""  
  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to shadows and pain  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to death in ""His"" name

"
1129,Gary Numan,Deadliner,"So I close my eyes and drift into sleep  
But something is here  
In the dark, in the dream  
Like a cruel wind clutching my heart  
I feel more than I see  
Like a clue to a nightmare that I can't believe  
Then it touches me and I try to scream  
And a thought tears me inside  
And I will do anything  
Anything, you understand?  
Just to wake up  
  
Sometimes it almost makes me cry  
Sometimes it seems to call my name out loud  
Sometimes it feels like I'm alone  
And then it comes for me again  
  
I'm told it's called 'The unreality dream'  
I'm told it's called 'The great American lie'  
I'm told that this is like the vengeance of God  
I can't believe that God would do this to me  
  
I've known fear many times but nothing like this  
I'm so scared I can't breathe  
I know I'm asleep but I know this is real  
And nothing can help me here  
I'm deep inside something and I may never come back  
And then it was gone  
And then I realized that 'The Rush' brought it in  
And I will never sleep alone again  
  
Sometimes it almost breaks my heart  
Sometimes I swear I hear it laugh at me  
Sometimes it feels like I could die  
And then it leaves my dreams again  
  
Feels like I'm fighting the possession of my soul  
I'm told that this is called 'The sickness of need'  
I've got to cut the sex connection and slide  
A word of warning to the weary and wise

"
1130,Gary Numan,Devious,"I remember one girl  
Saw her again in a magazine  
Front cover, big star  
Showing things that I'd never seen  
Well maybe  
Can you feel it? Can you?  
I remember one girl  
Who'd believe she'd be so devious  
Bad decision, bad move  
She told the papers everything  
Well maybe  
Do you need it, do you?  
Do you want it, do you?  
Come and get it  
I remember one girl  
She'd only make friends in expensive cars  
Television, good wine  
Leather seats and a friend of mine  
Well maybe  
Something's coming  
Oh no  

"
1131,Gary Numan,Devotion,"Charm up, strange down  
Old face, new sound.  
Same kick, same pain  
Same reason, same game so.  
Dance, let's move.  
I can't dance, I can't sing  
I'm too old, I'm too thin so?  
Motion, I'm in love  
One night's enough so.  
Dance, let's move.  
You can play  
You can lose  
You can't win  
('I'm still looking for rhythm')  
You can choose  
Move up, I don't like this motion  
Move out, I don't like this feeling  
Move up, I don't need devotion  
Move out, I don't need a reason.  
'And I'm still looking for the rhythm.'  

"
1132,Gary Numan,"Empty Bed, Empty Heart","You let me down  
How cold love can be  
I've nothing more to lose  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I don't sleep without you  
Empty bed, empty heart  
I'm trapped inside and dying  
I'm trapped inside and I'll wait for you  
Years and years and years  
How strange love can be  
It bends and tears and screams  
But only here inside me  
But only here inside me  
I don't live without you  
There's nothing I can do  
I'm waiting always waiting  
I'm waiting oh but don't leave me now  
I'm here forever  
You don't come  
You don't come forever  

"
1133,Gary Numan,Engineers,"All that we are  
Is all that we need to be  
All that we know  
Is you and machinery  
We're engineers  
  
We are your heartbeat  
We are your night life  
We are your 'low-line'  
We keep you alive for now  
We're engineers  
  
We are your voice  
We are your blood flow  
We are your eyes  
We're all you need to know  
We're engineers  
  
All that we are  
Is all that you'd love to be  
All that we know  
Is hate and machinery  
We're engineers

"
1134,Gary Numan,Exhibition,"Applicant, I am  
Clean young flesh  
Cubicles, we merge  
And me so decent  
  
Lock up my vehicle  
Crack my walls  
I'm stealing new words  
And me so honest  
  
Someone took pictures  
Just look at her go  
Her presence exhausted me  
Like spectators we are  
  
I have no address  
'Who are you?'  
Kiss my arse goodbye  
The show goes rusty.  
  
Simulate phone call  
Face to face  
Newspaper loose talk  
You wreck my dreams  
  
Exhibit 'A' dog  
So few of them left  
Exhibit 'be' god  
The problem of death  
  
Old sex, unclean  
Do you still need the moon?  
Recall no names  
Don't ask me 'how are you?'  
  
Where's my attendant  
And where is my wife  
Wait in the doorway  
While I say goodnight  
  
He looks like me  
  

"
1135,Gary Numan,Exile,"I heard it in my sleep  
A voice more dead than old  
I thought I'd known the fear  
But then it touched my soul and said:  
  
You will pray for me  
Bow your head to me.  
  
It came for me at night  
And took me dream by dream  
To where everything is dark  
And no-one hears you scream  
Took everything I loved  
And turned love into pain  
It said I'm the prophecy  
And I'll make you believe in me.  
  
Sacrifice for me  
Be humility.  
  
It said:  
I'll make everyone pay  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forget  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forgive  
I'll make everyone pay.  
  
And so it comes to this  
Death or eternity?  
Or would you like to pay  
For all humanity?  
Do you believe in faith?  
Than choose. heaven or hell or me?  
A shadow on the sane  
The final treachery of god.  
  
You will kneel for me  
Lose your eyes for me.  
  
Betray the world for me  
Burn your soul for me.  
  
It said:  
I'll make everyone pay  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forget  
I'll make everyone pay  
Some things you can't forgive  
I'll make everyone pay.

"
1136,Gary Numan,Face To Face,"What's it like to be face to face with me?  
Playing tricks with hearts quite as young as yours  
Do you know what the reunion pays for you?  
Do you feel like I'm supposed to do?  
  
I could be love  
I could be your assassin. I don't know  
  
Pictures of my face dissappear with time  
They gave boys to quite tasteless friends of mine  
Re-arrange thoughts to 'what will be will be'  
There is no god so pray to me

"
1137,Gary Numan,Films,"I don't like the film  
I don't like the film  
Play it all back  
Play it all back  
  
And I don't like the scenery  
And I don't like the set so  
Pull it all down  
Pull it all down  
  
But I like the actors  
And I like the show  
  
We're so exposed  
We're so exposed  
Anything can happen  
Anything can happen  
  
Don't let them see  
Don't let them know  
And you wonder why  
And you wonder why  
  
Turn off the lights  
And turn off the sound

"
1138,Gary Numan,Fold,"I fold your letter  
All lies, all cold  
I fold my memories  
My life, my soul  
I fold compassion  
And vengeance bleeds through  
I fold forgiveness  
And wait for you  
Do you hear me?  
Can you hear me fall?  
Do you feel me?  
Can you feel at all?  
I hear you calling  
I hear you calling  
I fold all reason  
Screaming your name  
I fold Your heart and  
Feed on your pain  
I hear you calling  
I hear you calling  
Can you feel?  
Can you feel?  

"
1139,Gary Numan,For The Rest Of My Life,"Look around. Do you see?  
Everything is fading  
Everything just fades away  
Look around. Do you see?  
Everyone looks lonely  
But there's only you and me  
  
Do you wonder how we came to be here?  
Do you wonder if we could find us from here?  
Look inside. Do you feel anything but bitter?  
Anything but sad and lost?  
Look inside. Do you dream of a time that's better?  
Do you ever dream of me?  
And my heart breaks when you cry in your sleep.  
So I can't wait here hoping I'm something you'll keep.  
  
I will love you. Miss you. All of my life.  
I will need you. Want you. All of my life.  
But I've lost you. Lost you. For the rest of my life.

"
1140,Gary Numan,Found You Now,"I know that you already take as read  
I helped you  
You know the back of my hand  
  
I wish that we were enchanted  
Girl, now I take it for granted  
  
Your love was starin me right in the heart  
Why does our pride make us weak?  
While I was wonderin where to start  
You were there to show me  
All I had to learn  
  
You were way off the mark  
Most of it in the dark  
Found you now  
  
Tiny light, give the peace  
With which we reach indecision  
I guess we lived in the meantime  
Till we remembered our first lines  
  
We must have missed a turn  
Still got a lot to learn  
Found you now  
  
So now we live a life of give and take  
Day by day  
We don't control where it leads us  
  
If we compare the first day we met  
I must admit nothings changed  
I recognize only one regret  
Life embarassments unexpressed  
  
Found you now  
Found you now

1142,Gary Numan,Generator,"We generate heat  
We generate emotion  
We generate a feeling  
That is better left here  
Than a memory on a wall  
  
I'd rather cry than forget you  
  
We generate pain  
We generate suspicion  
We generate a rumour that's sick  
But a rumour that is probably true  
  
I'd rather die than forget you

I'm talking sex motion  
I'm talking 'bout fashion

We generate pictures  
We generate a video film

I'd rather lose than forgive you  
  
We generate shame  
We generate secrets  
We generate a reason for living  
And we generate a reason for not

I can't believe what I've seen  
I can't believe what I'm doing to you  
  

"
1143,Gary Numan,God Only Knows,"I was waiting for something  
I was listening to my breathing  
Like a man listening to life  
  
I was looking for fire  
It could take me or leave me  
It could all just burn away  
  
The oxygen law  
It remains me  
  
I'd been surrounded for hours  
By the sound of thinking metal  
And I knew something was wrong  
  
I can tell you what fear is  
It is the smell of burning  
And I'd been close once before  
  
I waited a long time  
How I survived God only knows  
It seemed like forever  
How I survived God only knows  
I don't like the memory  
How I survived God only knows  
How I survived God only knows  
  
I remember the feeling  
I'll remember forever  
How it all just came apart  
  
I don't believe in praying  
I don't believe in a God  
Now I question everything  
  
The dreamer is gone  
I'm an old man  
  
I could tell you of horror  
I could show you the pieces  
But I just want to forget  
  
I'm not sure if I saw it  
I'm not sure if I heard it  
I just screamed 'I can't get out'  
'I can't get out'  

"
1144,Gary Numan,Haunted,"And I can not be saved  
Not by you  
Not by God  
I want to bleed  
And I can hardly breath  
Look at me  
Falling down  
Before your eyes  
All I've needed  
Takes me away from you  
All I've wanted  
Takes me away from you  
All I live for  
Takes me away from you  
All I'd die for  
Takes me away from you  
And this is not my voice  
Not my face  
Not my life  
It belongs to you  
And you will not believe  
The things I've seen  
The things I've done  
All in your name  
All I've needed  
Takes me away from you  
All I've wanted  
Takes me away from you

Takes me away from you

1145,Gary Numan,Here Am I,"I'll say good-bye for now  
All this love burns away

They'll crawl for you

1146,Gary Numan,I Am Dust,"We we're dust in a world  
Of grim obsession.  
  
We were torn from our  
Life of isolation.  
  
We we're pulled from our path  
Of least resistance.  
  
And the songs we sang  
What became of us?  
  
We're here waiting for you  
We're here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
  
We all pray for the end  
For the god to take us.  
  
We we're falling down  
One by one.  
  
We we're weak and the fear  
Was all around us.  
  
The machines screamed from  
Moon to sun.  
  
We're here waiting for you  
We're here waiting for you  
  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you  
We are yours  
We're waiting for you

1147,Gary Numan,I Can't Breathe,"I'm scared to sleep, I'm scared to dream  
I'm scared to wake up in case I scream  
I'm scared to whisper one word  
That's all it needs  
  
I hear it breathe, I hear it sigh  
I hear it laughing when something dies  
I hear it calling  
But I'm too scared to move  
  
I'm so scared  
I can't breathe  
I'm so scared  
I can't breath  
I'm so scared  
I just can't breathe  
  
I'm scared to look, I'm scared to see  
I'm scared of mirrors in case it's me  
I'm scared of memories  
But now that's all I have  
  
So I can't leave and nothing comes  
So no-one noticed that I've come undone  
I'd hide in shadows  
But the shadows talk to me  
  
I'm so scared  
I can't breathe  
I'm so scared  
I can't breath  
I'm so scared  
I just can't breathe

1148,Gary Numan,Icehouse,"I'm playing at ice  
But I'm finding it hard  
She didn't break the wall  
She just caught me off guard  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
I'm just a little bit sorry  
But I haven't decided why  
Could it be my memory  
Or did I ever really cry  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
  
Fill my head with your false feelings  
I can't trust anything you say  
Today I missed a special friend  
That never really cared anyway  
  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes  
Can you see ice in my eyes

Your only chance is break the state  
  
We are clean  
Don't ask, I'm an agent  
  
Send in change  
Secretaries, nothing more  
You can be replaced you know  
  
Send in chance  
Bad conditions, talk of leaving  
Talk of walking out on me  
  
Send in you  
Send in pain, send in lies  
Send in words that I believe  
  
Send in you

Something, give this game away

1150,Gary Numan,Jagged,"They say I'm unforgiven and I have to pay  
Like I'm the demon resurrection  
They say that I turn innocence to panic  
But I don't care  
  
They say that my obsession is unholy  
That I deviate from reason  
They say I make you suffer for my sins  
I hope you forgive me  
  
Do you want it? [Repeat: x1]  
My desire  
  
I sink to my knees  
Head in my hands  
So now I'm just a shadow on their bleeding hearts  
This is why the righteous never learn  
I'm like a dead man hiding in the dark  
  
What do you need? [Repeat: x1]  
  
What have we become?  
All that we could be?  
Think of this as mercy, a small gift from me  
What does a confession ever do  
But take my guilt away  
  
Do you want it?  
Do you want it?  
My desire  
  
I Feel It Fall  
I Feel It Fall From Me  
I Feel It Fall Down

1151,Gary Numan,Listen To My Voice,"Listen to my voice  
And please try to understand  
The one you call Messiah is a lie

You are not the plan  
And your beginning to annoy  
You will never see  
You will never know eternal peace  
The places promised by your faith  
The God you love is gone  
He lies broken by your shame  
The thing that took His place already died  
Send black Angels for you  
It will send Angels  
I am just a voice  
Only you are pure enough for truth  
That no-one else will hear  
And then tear away belief  
You must write 'The Book'  
Only you can save the light of man  
It will send Angels  
Send black Angels for you

That you're at the gates of Heaven  
I can't believe  
That we'll never know you

Miracles happened every day  
If only, if only  
I could believe in something  
  
Helpless we cried over you  
Empty and lost over you  
  
How in the world  
Can they say that you're at peace?  
How in the world  
Can they say that time will heal us?  
  
How in the world  
Can we hope to be forgiven?  
How in the world  
Can we know how we feel?  
  
If only, if only  
We could all live forever  
If only, if only  
No memories to remember  
  
Words were not spoken for you  
No grave marks our love for you  
Broken our hearts call for you

How in the world can we live without you

Say they were the best of times  
Dancing till the big bell chimes  
Oh how the memory shines

Save me  
Save me  
  
Sometimes I wonder, does an angel die?  
Rest in peace  
Here with me?  
  
Sometimes I wonder if a soul can cry?  
I feel a pain  
Next to mine  
  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
I don't think He died for me  
  
I know that Heaven is a burnt out shell

Like you.

If I could make the change  
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall  
Did you?  
  
And who are you

We would sing the new leader's song  
Everyone invented stories  
The connection was a fragile thing  
Far too many distractions.

We all rearrange the same old song.

We're going in  
  
So this  
Is death and  
It's so  
Calm I'm surprised

No sign of life  
Only the whisper of air

My God how time flies  
I close up my brain  
And another friend dies

Feel like nothing is mine  
I could go back to crying  
But now dying seems fine  
So I hang from the ceiling  
Or I sit on the air  
Or rot in a corner  
Until somebody cares  
Faces at random  
I quote people I knew  
I'd love to be like me  
If I can feel like you  
Here am I more roche five than pain  
Here am I just me and my walls to blame  
Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane  
Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain  
Lock my door I only think in black and white  
I'll even try to look ashamed  
Moving out of central  
Somebody knows me well  
Says he'll spill the whole story  
He may be lying I can't tell  
Meet me inside  
I'll keep my head to the floor  
And one hand on the handle  
Of the mad sane door  
Here am I more roche five than pain  
Here am I just me and my walls to blame  
Here am I, I really don't feel quite sane  
Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain

We need something we need to play.

Office in a sidestreet is no place for you  
Night talk and romance like beat the clock.  
  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But it's so easy to do  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk.  
  
Take things slow you can crack  
Like your face I don't understand  
How you smile and pretend it's fun  
Do you laugh when the rats come round to play?  
  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But it's so easy to do  
Boys like me aren't supposed to cry  
But just look at you  
Night talk.  

"
1164,Gary Numan,No More Lies,"Everything  
Everything reminds me  
Easily  
You walking out so easily  
No goodbyes  
Not even a tear for me  
Now you cry  
Youd like to have my company  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
No more lies  
I don't need this anymore  
I've heard it all  
Now I'm gonna close the door  
Seems to me  
Nothing comes that easily  
Time to leave  
Youll take it all and run from me  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone  
  
But I'm not gonna call you again  
I'm not gonna pick up the phone  
No I'm not going through it again  
Youre not gonna leave me alone

1165,Gary Numan,Noise Noise,"Whats it to you  
If I feel now  
Just a face in the wall  
Crawling out of the ground  
Now look at me  
You cry  
Like a leaf in the fall  
I fly in the sky, dont you?  
  
Whats it to you  
This noise noise  
Like a plaque on the wall  
One of these days  
Ill just leave  
(whats it to you? )  
As boys drown  
You feel like young gods  
You know  
All young gods must fade  
(whats it to you? )  
  
Whats it to you  
Going down boys  
Like a screw in the wall  
My lovers never leave in love  
Play war like marines  
Just noise noise  
Just roar roar  
One of these days  
  
(whats it to you? )

"
1166,Gary Numan,Not The Love We Dream Of,"Sometimes things don't work out the way you planned  
Sometimes words don't say the things you mean  
Sometimes you can't explain the way you feel  
Sometimes when we smile we tell the same lie  
  
With a whisper, everything you know  
Is torn away and life just stops  
With a whisper, everything you are  
Just falls apart and dies  
  
And all those things that you meant to change  
Are thoughts lost on the way to this  
And all those sorries you never said  
Are words lost on the wind  
  
Did you ever wonder about the end?  
Did you ever you wish that I was still there?  
Did you ever call my name by mistake?  
Did you ever cry yourself to sleep?  
  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the love that binds us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the care that holds us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the time that shares us  
Slowly, slowly, we lose the heart to save us  
  
Sometimes things are not the way they seem  
Sometimes friends are not the friends they seem  
Sometimes time is not the cure it seems  
Sometimes love is not the love we dream of

"
1167,Gary Numan,Oh! Didn't I Say,"Hollow  
Faces staring through my window  
Sometimes  
I can play a boy you might know  
Station  
Standing cold and old I'm insane  
Gender  
Is uncertain just like my name  
  
The lemon kid is my friend  
But even he don't know me well  
Oh that's too bad  
The waiter is an old man  
Who looks at me so sly and strange  
What's on his mind  
  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
  
Queenie  
From a doorway says ""You got time?""  
Panic  
Not tonight if you don't mind  
Oh no  
My fear of streets I cover  
Today  
My room is home for hours  
  
You can stay if you know your lines  
But please take care  
I'll suck your mind dry  
You'll never guess  
And you can never know me  
I'll change if I begin to feel  
What's your name  
  
Zero hero says I'm no-one  
He could be right but who's to know  
Man from the sky  
Oh well I'm growing tired of this place  
I think it's time to change my face  
You can't even try  
  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
  

"
1168,Gary Numan,On Broadway,"They say that  
Neon lights are bright on broadway  
They say there's always magic in the air  
But when you're walking down the street  
And you aint had enough to eat  
The city all lights up and you're nowhere  
  
They say  
The girls are something else on broadway  
Looking at them just gives me the blues  
Cause howre you gonna make some time  
When all you got is one thin dime  
And one thin dime wont even shine your shoes  
  
They say that  
Love wont last too long on broadway  
Now catch a greyhound bus for home  
They all say  
I bet they're wrong, I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I wont quit till I'm a star  
On broadway

"
1169,Gary Numan,One Perfect Lie,"One. One perfect lie.  
Was it told too soon?  
And one, one perfect life  
Turned to stone  
Cold mercy  
  
I kneel down by your grave  
I kneel down torn and guilty  
  
Did I let you down,  
Say goodbye too soon?  
And did you understand  
My mistake?  
Forgive me  
  
I kneel down by your side  
I kneel down scared and helpless  
  
One perfect lie  
Wrapped in kindness and tears  
I wish I believed in your heaven  
One perfect life  
Led by blind faith and trust  
If God has a heart he will find you  
  
I'm torn and guilty  
I'm torn and guilty  
I'm torn and guilty

"
1170,Gary Numan,Only A Downstat,"Only a downstat  
Personality problem  
He would say things like 'I love you'  
And cry real tears  
Met him in some place  
Like a home for old mothers  
Where the cure is always death  
But no-one ever leaves  
He wore a number 7  
Badge on his collar  
He would show it with pride  
And say 'it means I can feel'  
He'd bribe the warders  
To send letters to someone  
Who didn't even know his name  
But said she'd read them anyway  
And in the evening (??)  
He writes poetry for people  
Who deny he's alive  
And say 'I'll mention that name'  
A violator of the law of no feelings  
They should be put in the chair  
Until their eyes come in (??)  
If you have reasons  
I might sell you my time  
I'll leave it under the stairs  
In a body of mine  
Old memories are slowly fading out of me  
We are the unknowns, we are all you need  
  

"
1171,Gary Numan,Outland,"I'm in Outland  
Sex tension  
She whispers things I need  
Look in her heart  
Slow motion  
'I've been expecting you.'  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  
I'm in Outland  
Storm my heart  
Tear me up if you like.  
Come closer  
Say nothing  
I've got something for you.  
I shape sound  
I shape time  
I'll shape your world for you.  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  
I'm in Outland  
Emotion  
Dark whispers in my head.  
Got the sex scream  
On new film  
I've got the friend I need.  
Don't play safe  
Don't play clean  
Don't play if you can't lose.  
I'm in Outland  
I'll do anything.  

"
1172,Gary Numan,Play Like God,"I was young  
I was cold but not insane  
I had one good friend  
It was a voice without a name  
And so here we are  
Same need and same mistake  
But it could be yours  
You see it could be even be yours  
I said I've done things  
That left me hurt and ashamed  
She said all I need  
Is a place to hide the pain  
She said don't trust dreams  
Because dreams will break your heart  
I said little girls play in the house of shame  
Some of us play like God  
Play like God,  
Save my soul  
Play like God  
I know that God don't live here in my heart  
She said touch my soul  
I've never touched someone so cold  
She said touch my heart  
I've never touched something so old  
She said play like God  
And then you can play with me  
I moved underground  
And caught the isolation blues  
Sound familiar?  
I said kiss my face  
I've seen things you'll never see  
She said kiss my arse  
I've been everything I need  
She said memories  
Are only there to make you bleed  
I said little girls play in big boys games  
Some of us play but cry  
Play like God  
Save my soul  
Play like God  
I know that God don't live here in my world  
Where do we belong?  
She said I've been sick  
But then no-one's clean for long  
She said pray for me  
Like God, I've fucked the world  
I said little girls play with the big disease  
Some of us play with you  

"
1173,Gary Numan,Pressure,"Here is my  
Small black box  
Filled with hurt  
Sent by you  
Here is my  
Small black book  
Filled with lies  
Told by you  
Here is my  
Small black house  
Filled with fear  
Thanks to you  
Here is my  
Small black heart  
Filled with shame  
Left by you  
See I  
See I Don't know  
And I don't feel the pressure  
And I don't feel the pressure  
Here is my  
Small black doubt  
Filled by tears  
Cried for you  
here is my  
Small black wish  
Filled by dreams  
Lost by you  
See I  
See I Don't know  
And I don't feel the pressure  
And I don't feel the pressure

1174,Gary Numan,Pure,"I want to feel you hesitate  
I want to feel you pull away  
I want to feel you realize  
That I am not love come to play  
  
I want to feel your pink clean skin  
I want to feel your purity  
I want to feel you touch my pain  
I want to drown in your misery  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, bitch, this is what you are  
Purified, sanctified, sacrificed  
Hey, bitch, this is what you are  
Purified, sanctified, sacrificed  
This is what you are  
  
I want to feel your innocence  
I want to hear you beg for 'Him'  
I want to be your animal  
I want to be your only sin  
  
I want to tear your dreams away  
And show you hopes last sanctuary  
I want to dip your wings in blood  
And watch an angel bleed for me

1175,Gary Numan,Remember I Was Vapour,"[Chorus]  
There's nothing here but us  
There's nothing here but us  
  
Remember, I was vapor  
Remember, I was just like you  
Remember, I was liquid  
Remember, I was someone too  
  
Remember, I need others  
Remember, I need oxygen  
Remember, I need lovers  
Remember, I need to forget  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember, I am human  
Remember, I feel just like you  
Remember, I had reasons  
Remember, I had friends like you  
  
Remember, I grow tired  
Remember, I could end all this  
Remember, I have memories  
Remember, I need to forget

1176,Gary Numan,Remind Me To Smile,"We'll take a taxi to the show  
We could report by phone  
We could remind ourselves that  
We must laugh  
  
Reconsider: 'fame'  
I need new reasons  
This is detention it's not fun at all  
  
[Chorus]  
Remind me to smile  
You know, 'the old friends' line  
It gets so I feel like  
I'm in this cold, glass, cage  
  
I've got the horrors  
Check, over my shoulder  
I punch the air and fight but  
No-one's there  
  
You you oh no  
Old scars don't show  
We fall you see  
Crawl crawl in love  
I dive so clean  
Young things don't scream  
Toys toys so far  
Boys boys you are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get off the car  
Get off the phone  
Move from my window, leave me alone  
  
Keep your revivals  
Keep your conventions  
Keep all your fantasies that's all we are

"
1177,Gary Numan,Replicas,"It was hard to avoid  
I suppose it was the shame  
But they didn't even try  
You see we'd never met  
And they didn't have names  
There was nothing I could do  
  
So I turned on the crowd  
And I screamed 'you and you'  
'It could have been you'  
And they seemed to think  
That I looked that way  
Or maybe I was wrong  
  
So I said  
Do you know Mr. wall  
And they looked the other way  
And then they smiled at me  
  
But the police came  
And I said it was me  
And I just walked away

"
1178,Gary Numan,Respect,"That's OK  
If that's the way you wanna play it  
I don't mind  
I can play it anyway  
You won't stop  
Until I pul you to pieces  
Which I will in time  
But I'm still curious  
You're so young  
Not one backbone between you  
But you think you'll make a hero  
Quite peculiar  
You're just boys  
You don't know what you've angered  
Did you know you're talking to the heart  
Of the machine?  
Welcome boys  
Welcome to the real world  
I could almost be sorry  
But I could be wrong  
I know you  
I know what you've been doing  
I know where you live  
And I know where you are  
You know me  
I'm the smiling assassin  
You know I won't forgive  
And you know I won't forget  

"
1179,Gary Numan,Rip,"I'll get down on my knees  
I'll do anything I can  
I'll even walk upon water  
I'll burn the soul of a man  
I'm so sick with pain  
I'm so sick with need  
I'll lay before the cross and pray  
I've done nothing to you  
I'll bleed like holy rain  
I'll say I'm searching for the truth  
I'll rip the skin from God's face  
If it can guide me to you  
I'll give life to disease  
I'll steal the light from Heavens gate  
I'll give life to obsession  
And then I'll do as I please  
I'll give you one last sin or cure  
I've got something for you  
  

"
1180,Gary Numan,Rip It Up,"The new law is moving in  
Now you see them now you don't  
Like a Shadow in my diguise  
Like a soft machine on ice  
Who are you?  
'I'm the man  
I am the cure and disease'  
Who am I?  
I'm the need  
I am the weakness that feeds  
I've got to rip it up  
I've got to tear it down  
I've got to break the word  
I've got to fight for you  
Who am I to criticise  
I'm unsafe at any speed  
'We can change the world' she said  
Never changed it never tried  
I'm cold and hard  
But I don't mind  
I've been everything I can be  
I've been sick  
And I've got he screams  
These boys don't know when to push  
Did you know that I don't run  
Did you know that I don't hide  
Did you know that I don't sleep  
Did you know that I don't care  
I am the soft machine  
I am the word and the law  
I am the new machine  
I am your feelings and more  
Come inside and Play with me  
I'll show you things to forget  
No-one talks  
And no-one leaves  
No-one remembers the way  
I've got to fight the man  
I've got to fight the need  
I've got to fight the law  
I've got to fight the word  

"
1181,Gary Numan,Rumour,"I listen to rumours  
Stone cold and bleeding  
They burn my heart away  
Left me alone and afraid  
Words seem to leave me  
Just when I needed them  
Just like I need you  
Like I'm supposed to do  
They say:  
Love is deceiving  
She won't stay forever  
Love is deceiving  
Is all that she knows  
Love is deceiving  
She'll leave you forever  
Love is deceiving  
She comes and she goes  
I wonder  
I wonder  
I listen to rumours  
Listen to everyone  
Everyone but you  
And now it's all too late  

"
1182,Gary Numan,Scanner,"I would take your place  
If your world fell down  
I would take your pain  
And leave a smile  
For you  
  
If you feel a kiss  
When your dreams are dark  
And a voice guides you home  
When you are lost  
That was me  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]  
  
I will keep you warm  
And I'll wipe your tears away  
I'm a shadow  
Watching over you  
All my life  
  
I would die for you  
I would give the world to you  
And I'd sell my soul to keep you safe  
I love you  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]  
  
And when God comes for me  
I won't go far  
Like a smile in your heart  
I won't be far away  
  
If you're afraid and need to find me  
I'll be here with you  
And when you dream and hear me calling  
You'll see me again  
  
Sometimes love breaks my heart [Repeat: x1]

1183,Gary Numan,Scar,"I'm not  
Crawling around  
Looking for a friend.  
I'm not  
Thinking the big I am.  
I'm not  
Down on the ground  
Looking for a cure.  
I'm not  
Saying that I'm the man.  
  
And I'm not asking for your opinion.  
I'm not asking for a miracle.  
And I'm not asking you to remember me,  
Not asking for the ghost to call.  
  
I'm  
Cold and corrupt  
Looking for a heart.  
I'm  
Trying to hide my scars.  
I'm  
Talking to you  
Like a shadow in the dark.  
I'm  
Just trying to survive.  
  
(Call my name, hide my shame)  
I call this human emotion.  
(Save my soul, save my soul)  
I call this human corrosion.  
  
And I'm not asking you for emotion,  
I'm not asking for the sky to mend.  
And I'm not asking you for nostalgia,  
I'm not asking for the world to end.  
And I'm not asking for your opinion,  
I'm not asking for a miracle.  
And I'm not asking you to remember me,  
Not asking for the ghost to call

1184,Gary Numan,She's Got Claws,"You are distraction  
Like pictures on the wall  
I don't like eyes  
  
You are attraction  
It gets to be routine  
You're up, I'm down  
  
She's got claws  
But the factory knows  
We're dreams in cold storage  
We could dance the night away  
  
You say you love me  
Maybe you do  
A patience I can't steal  
I don't believe you  
You said 'Straight'  
It's like giving up hope  
  
Here on the ground  
On the floor  
Screaming nothing at all  
Here on the ground  
Like some whore  
Looking down on you all  
Too much advice  
I'm not sure  
  
Laughing hyenas  
With pens for charm  
You'll just suck in the boys  
We have to leave soon  
Shudder. 'The Door'  
This house is far too cool  
  
She's got claws  
But the factory knows  
We're dreams in cold storage  
We could dance the night away

1185,Gary Numan,Sister Surprise,"We are  
Walking nostalgia  
Like old movies for real

Look at them, look at us

Sell a slim body to the man next door  
Sell a slim body to the man next door  
Like my sister surprise  
  
We'll wait for you  
  
We are  
The pleasure creation  
Gone wrong. gone wrong.  
  
We are  
Walking ghost stories  
No religion  
No relief  
No old wisdom  
No belief  
Sometimes I could scream  
  
We'll wait for you

You can crawl on the floor  
You can scream if you want to  
But I won't unlock the door  
  
You can sleep in bus shelters  
You can sleep in the park  
But I'll rip up the trees  
Until you tear yourself apart  
  
But I don't love you  
No I don't love you  
Do you dream?  
  
Back to surveillance  
Open eyes and wash out 'tear'  
A sign that says 'no exit'  
And 'no-one can save you here'  
  
I could talk about my programme  
Where everything is white  
I could specialize in pictures  
Where nothing's ever right  
  
But I don't love you  
No I don't love you  
Do you dream?  
  
We are just sound  
We are just noise  
And we are all here to lie  
Do you dream?  
  
You sleep by windows  
You sleep by windows  
  
Do you cry?  
Do you dream?  
Do you?  
Did you?

1187,Gary Numan,Slowcar To China,"She'll take a slowcar to China  
She'll pay the rent for the use of you  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
She'll pay the rent for the use of you tonight.  
  
We are not afraid to love, but no new ideas  
You almost get used to such things you know.  
The mechanics on the phone again, we break down.  
The others you'd remember if I could spare some time.  
  
In love with this elegant bitch  
And here am I just a shy young fool  
In love with this elegant bitch  
She only sparkles at times for you tonight.  
  
She forgets that we know,  
She forgets who we are  
  
I suppose the things I overheard were quite by chance  
The only story I ever knew or cared for  
Best left unheard I suppose, don't you?  
You look for somewhere to start to look  
  
We'll take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here  
We'll take a slowcar to China  
Everything that you need is here tonight.  
  
I forgot not to call,  
And now we're out of love.  
  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head  
She'll take a slowcar to China  
A little green worm inside my head tonight.  
  
There's nothing much to keep us alive, but 'Dance'.  
All that she can say is goodbye. All things change I suppose  
We'll sing without voice, without heart and leave no address  
I well never ever see you again. I know.  
  
Don't take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one so  
Don't take a slowcar to China  
She needed nothing and no one here tonight.  
  
You will pay like before.  
Always one step behind.  
You will pay Mr Jones.  
Always one step away.  
  
There's no one here to leave you behind but me.

There is no point in going on tonight  
Something's in the house  
Something's on the stairs  
War's in the air  
The queer is out of order  
And me I'm on the ground  
But that's no place to be  
  
Jack Burroughs says ""what you doing""  
""Oh me I'm going home""  
""Oh what a shame""  
Nothing has changed  
And nothing is new  
These days

"
1189,Gary Numan,Stories,"She sits in the corner  
Where it's reasonably quiet  
Drinking coffee with cream  
Thinking stories of young love  
She calls to the waiter  
'Won't you lend me some time?  
You can sit by my side  
And I'll let you be friends with mine.'  
  
The cafe is old  
But the candlelight's new  
She orders Beaujolais wine  
And says 'I've thought of you too'  
  
She whispers 'isn't it odd  
You remind me of songs  
That I'd rather forget  
Like feelings I longed for  
  
You haunt me inside  
Sometimes I recall  
Question mistakes  
Who grew to nothing at all'  
  
I hear voices that cry  
And one of them's mine  
All the things I could say  
Are the reasons I can't  
She says 'I've seen you before  
In thoughts I call 'son'  
Like an old film with sound  
When the link comes undone'  
  
The waiter is me  
And the woman is you  
And we are the story  
Just like others I knew

"
1190,Gary Numan,Telekon,"Where is my outline I start to fade  
No concentration means 'fail' these days  
  
I leave the table saying 'i am real'  
I feel the pressure like your eyes on me  
Don't mention that name and books on love  
I can't be sure, I can't be sure  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You quote from 'anxious' and things we do  
I need protection from the likes of you  
  
Do you begin to see that I don't know  
I live on memories that are hard to find  
Send me a card and write 'i think of you'  
I'll say you lied, I'll say you're lying  
  
You are, you are  
  
Tell me a secret I'm sure to fall  
My dog runs a.w.o.l. I blame you all  
  
We're in formation saying 'safe, safe, safe'  
Turn up my collar and mix with dark  
The speaker turns on me spot her eyes  
It's hard to breathe, it's hard to breathe  
  
You end on reel one  
You end on reel one  
  
You are, you are

"
1191,Gary Numan,That's Too Bad,"I look up and the camera eye is  
Searching my room  
The t.v. screen is calling me  
But for what or whom  
Please mister do be careful  
I'm so fragile  
Maybe they'll let me down  
To speedy's place for a while  
  
Oh well that's too bad  
Oh well that's too bad  
  
I talk a lot, a sign of fear,  
I thought you should know  
I can see pictures of me well  
They're so-so  
I'll come on to the leader  
Like I'm some hero  
He'll laugh and raise his dying eyes  
And just tell me to go  
  
1920 flashbacks for an hour or more  
Of crazy actors hiding  
In the doorways top floor  
Machines scream in anger  
From a thousand dead ends  
I turn my face, I crawl away,  
I look for a friend

"
1192,Gary Numan,The 1930's Rust,"Listen good  
Don't cry for me  
Don't cry anymore  
  
Now just shut your mouth  
This point of view  
Appeals to me  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight  
  
Same old smile  
That cracked a thousand hearts  
But not mine  
  
Same old line  
I've read the book  
And I know you well  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight  
  
What's this feeling  
That I don't believe  
No concern on my face  
  
What's it for  
You dream of something  
Like I dreamed of you  
  
Listen babe  
Say you've got no-one tonight

"
1193,Gary Numan,The Angel Wars,"I won't pray here  
Or bow my head  
I won't praise your name  
I won't kneel down  
  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of sane (Oh Lord)  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of hell (Father)  
I won't pray to you  
On this side of heaven again  
  
I don't need faith  
Forgiveness of sin  
I don't need saving  
I don't need lies  
  
I don't believe  
In the angel wars (Oh Lord)  
I don't believe  
In the virgin birth (Father)  
I don't believe  
In the cross on the hill (Jesus)  
I don't believe  
In the kindness of God to man  
  
I'll drive a stake  
Through the black of your heart (Oh Lord)  
I'll pull down your temples  
And burn every word (Father)  
I'll kill all the angels  
That show me 'The Light' (Jesus)  
I'll drift into darkness  
And tear out the soul of God

"
1194,Gary Numan,The Crazies,"Here in my room  
Where the paint dries like your face  
I'm still confusing love with need  
Tonight at 10  
I'll cry for a while  
They'll get me for sure  
It's just a question of time  
  
We're the crazies  
Some things I do  
I feel so ashamed  
But I have run of points of view  
The man is a thinker  
Who thought that he died  
Just sits in the corner  
Looking somewhat surprised  
  
We're the crazies  
I only exterminate  
In my spare time  
I fight the machine for the passers by  
I know I'm wrong  
But what makes you right  
The simple solution is to end it all  
  
We're the crazies

1195,Gary Numan,The Dream Police,"The dream police  
Slogan: what is on your mind?  
The airwave boys  
Junkies won't get radio time  
The purist league  
White trenchcoats in pre-war style  
The aging queens  
Mister won't you stay a while?  
  
In death row with harlow  
And others like you  
I point my finger of hate  
At your picture and love you and love you  
The radio is talking  
Is it you or me?  
I must admit  
It's far too late to dial police  
  
What is your name?  
We are the end of the line  
Her eyes went out  
Dreaming overdose on time  
Hey you old grey eyes  
Don't practice dying for real  
The only one  
September she knows I can feel

"
1196,Gary Numan,The Image Is,"I intrude on patience  
I intrude on young hearts  
I intrude on all such things  
That can take you by surprise  
Time and time again  
So?  
  
I've no welcome for you  
I've no welcome for talk  
I've no welcome in my house  
I've tried too long you know  
Time and time again  
  
Oh look there's a man inside  
The head's not the museum it's supposed to be  
We sleep with machines that breathe  
And some even have names the executive dream  
  
We're all so sincere  
I'll sing a song from the film that broke your heart  
Oh look at the smile that cracks  
Tomorrow we'll be civilized  
And buy the whole world clothes  
  
We don't believe in you  
We're specialized mechanics in repairing the bitch  
You bounce around my head  
You say it's a little but I'm sure it's ok

"
1197,Gary Numan,The Life Machine,"Me I've just died  
But some machine keeps on humming  
I'm just an extra piece of dead meat to keep running  
Why won't you let me die in peace?  
Why won't you let me die with some kind of honor?  
Why won't you let me die at all?  
I know  
You've got your principles  
  
My body lies immobile  
I left it days ago  
And me I watch from somewhere as the loved ones come and go  
I see them glancing at the switch  
I hear them whispering maybe it's better that way  
I see the love turn into feelings  
I know  
Aren't quite the same  
  
I see the men of learning  
Pacing to and fro  
But how can I expect the sane to ever know?  
I'd rather die than have no mind  
I know my brain is gone damaged beyond repair  
I see an empty shell below me  
I know  
I've had my time

"
1198,Gary Numan,The Machman,"I saw him turn on  
Like a machine in the park  
Saying 'please come with me'  
But you've been there before  
  
I saw him whirr away  
Into the night  
Like a nightmare on wheels  
Saying 'never again'  
  
I'd give it all up for you  
I'd even be a number just for you  
The strangest living boy  
You could ever wish to see  
  
'that's me'  
Yellowed newspapers  
Tell the story of someone  
'do you know this man? '  
  
Tomorrow the cure  
Only police ever  
See night time for real  
Turn on the light  
And cry 'no more, no more'  
  
I was standing outside your door  
Waiting for the grey men to go  
When my mind turned on me  
With a vengeance I had never known  
  
My own  
Everyone heard  
The voice on the radio  
Saying 'why move around  
  
And waste my time'  
There are no  
Independents anymore  
The tape is a circle  
But who really cares  
  
I saw you behind the wall  
I even heard you laugh at me  
You disgust me tonight  
With your answer to something new  
That's you

"
1199,Gary Numan,The Monday Troop,"Final bow  
In a disused music hall  
Of laughter and mime  
The airwave police  
Were the only  
Admirers to admire  
  
Sliding sideways in a rusty old Ford  
The drivers broke down and  
A young girl screams  
Walking through rock dreams  
Tall stories  
Mobile T.V. radio  
Nobody came  
  
The station is abandoned  
Deserted for peace day  
Some old man said 'Just do your best'  
And I think passed away  
  
My shadow is never far behind  
And I must find another role to play  
Visit maskmaker  
Please bend my mind  
Someone, no one  
I really don't mind  
Nobody cares

1200,Gary Numan,The Need,"Get the need  
Get it.  
I'm in the movies.  
  
Hello young thing  
I'm an old film star  
Maybe you've seen my picture.  
  
I need it  
Like an old newsreel  
I'm just fading away.  
  
Bang bang dear  
I've got the needles  
And I've got the need  
If you'd be so kind.  
  
Come on and feel the need in me  
Come on and feel the need.  
Feel it!  
  
Hello young thing  
I've got reverse instructions  
In the back of my car.  
  
I need it  
Don't cry till this thing is over  
And my friends applaud.  
  
Bang bang dear  
When can we do this again  
And put it all on film  
  
Hello young love  
I've got something to show you  
And please don't be ashamed.  
  
I'm the man  
I'm the atrocity film star  
And I've got the need.

1201,Gary Numan,The Pleasure Skin,"The sound of breathing  
""Protect the disease in me"" she says  
The sound of breathing  
I have never known fear like this before  
  
I remember  
""The Beauties's old but still as good"" she said  
I remember  
That I woke up in a cold dark room again  
  
We are new men  
We're the service, the pleasure skin  
We are new men  
No words, no image, no hope and fame  
  
No shelter  
You could feel the bitch outside the door  
No shelter  
She said ""nothing is leaving here alive""

1202,Gary Numan,The Seed Of A Lie,"I'm a ghost in the dark and I'm yours.  
I belong in the past and I'm yours.  
Like a song you forget, and I'm yours.  
Like a dream in the night, and I'm yours.  
  
The wrong place?  
The wrong time?  
I don't know.  
The wrong face?  
Yours or mine?  
I don't know.  
  
Like a tear when you sleep, I'll be yours.  
Like a scar that won't fade, I'll be yours.  
Like a pain in the cold, I'll be yours.  
Like a fear in the heart, I'll be yours.  
  
The wrong word when you cry  
I will be  
Like the seed of a lie  
I will be  
Like the germ of disease  
I will be  
Like the last one who cared  
I will be  
  
Like your shadow  
I will haunt you  
Do you remember?  
I said to you  
'Love is a mountain  
But harder to climb.  
It should be forever  
But love is unkind  
To me.  
Don't let me down.'  
  
And you let me down

1203,Gary Numan,The Tick Tock Man,"Look at your face  
It's so fortunately arranged  
Don't look back  
I can assure you that you won't like what you see  
  
You step on my dreams  
I could whisper  
You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and I'm so uneasy  
  
Hotel rooms, sweet dreams  
Like slot machines that call it 'Love love'  
A coin in the hole  
You young things never stay young for longe  
  
This edge in my voice  
But there's really nothing much to say  
My conscience mends  
I suppose it all meant something to you.

You intrude on me  
I could whisper  
You close in and I'm so uneasy

1205,Gary Numan,This Is New Love,"We are strangers here  
I suppose  
We are not welcome  
Or so I'm told.  
We are not old friends  
But believe this,  
We can be nightmares.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
This is new love.  
  
We are the hunters,  
So one by one  
You know we'll find you.  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
  
These boys of passion  
Will rule the world  
Put their fingers in a dyke  
Well you know it's what she needed.  
These boys of passion  
With cruel idiot smiles  
Fight for you.  
You know, they said so.  
  
Cold fascination  
With dead sound.  
Oh God let me sleep  
Forever.

Suggesting fading to silence  
And that must please you

1207,Gary Numan,Thoughts No. 2,"Sometimes I feel  
I live like a prisoner  
But I don't know  
If this really is pressure  
Surprise you win  
I'm lost as screamers roll in  
Sometimes I feel  
Like leaving this room I'm in  
  
Faded film people dropping words  
About the real things to say  
? (Not ""Someone pulls me deeper"", as in CD booklet)  
And tells me who I will be if I stay  
A clever machine writes pretty words  
For pretty boys  
To sing to us all  
We're all so grateful  
  
My face you cry  
And I show my darker side  
The night is yours  
And I just switch off and hide  
Cafe and sin  
The wine's not to my liking  
My face you cry  
Oh my didn't I say come in?  
  
Frown (?) in my eyes showing nothing  
But surprise about you  
And what are you thinking  
About my life and her drinking to you too  
A dying non-human writes unkind words  
For unkind friends  
And as for the tears, they'll never show  
Asylum people calling on my door  
From day to day  
The image must fall  
I've had my time

1208,Gary Numan,Time To Die,"And I have seen wonders  
And I have seen miracles  
Oh, I have seen some things  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And I have seen sadness  
And I have seen time run out  
I've even seen men cry  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain  
  
And my memories  
I can't give them away  
So it's easy  
Like a long long sleep  
  
I'm so tired  
Now it's my time to die  
Welcome home  
Welcome home  
  
No exhibition  
No screaming war songs  
No conversation  
No more opinions here  
  
And I have seen new wars  
And I have seen things  
That you wouldn't believe  
And I have seen my days  
It's all lost to me now  
Like tears in the rain

Or I'll forget how to dream.  
Chorus:  
I won't forget anything

I won't forgive anyone

Tread careful  
You hear the sound of my breathing  
Tread careful  
Because I feel this sound  
Tread careful  
I'm falling in a glasshouse  
I'm trying hard to begin  
Because I want it to get harder  
Tread careful  
Before I change my mind  
Tread careful  
I could surprise you  
I know something you want to do.

Tread careful  
I'm sure you don't care but  
Tread careful  
I could change your mind  
Tread careful  
I've been waiting for you  
There is no comfort in here.

1210,Gary Numan,Turn Off The World,"Got to pull it up  
Got to pull it out  
Got to survive  
Got to stay calm  
Got to think fast  
Don't want to burn  
Searching for a door  
Searching for a way  
Out of this thing  
I don't know what's wrong  
Don't know what to do  
I'm out of control  
Nothing I can do  
Nothing seems to work  
I'm barely alive  
Got to slow it down  
Got to do something  
Or give in  
Watching us fall  
Trying everything  
Fighting for life  
Running out of time  
I don't have a choice  
I'm riding it in  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
This is the fear  
This is nothing like  
You could believe  
Panic in my heart  
Like a cold hand  
Pulling at strings  
I'll do anything  
Even pray to God  
Just let me out  
Turn off the machine  
Turn off all the noise  
Turn off the world  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me  
I'm inside and I'm trying to get out  
I'm inside and I'm screaming for some help  
And everything's gone wrong  
I'm listening to the sound of my own fear  
I'm listening to the sound of someone's tears  
I'm listening to me

You learn fast when that's all that you can do  
You learn fast or nothing

And I know I like this beat  
I like your whispers  
I like your screams  
I like your lies  
And I'm sure I'd like your dreams  
You don't need opinions and rumours  
You don't need a voix in the dark  
You don't need to listen to strangers  
You don't need to tear out your heart  
I'll show you pictures  
I'll make you cry  
I'll show you things you've done  
And then I'll ask you why  
I don't need heroes  
I don't need this name  
I don't need favours  
And I know I don't need fame  
We don't need opinions and rumours  
We don't need a voix in the dark  
We don't need to listen to strangers  
We don't need to tear out our hearts  
One reason  
One secret  
One lie is  
Forever  
One nightmare  
One rumour  
Your shame is  
Forever  

"
1213,Gary Numan,Walking With Shadows,"All my life  
They've been here.  
Waiting for you.  
Patiently.  
They want your tears to fall  
All they want is your purest sin  
All they want is your heart and soul  
They want to welcome you in  
Innocent,  
But they will lead you  
Back to me.  
They will seem  
All they need is one tortured soul  
They need walking shadows  
All they need is your last confession  
They need your pain to show me  
I'm waiting for the unforgiven  
Waiting for you to come home  
Waiting for sleep to come  
I waiting for my one obsession  
  
'Innocence is pain in disguse'  
They said.  
Now I believe  
  

"
1214,Gary Numan,War Songs,"I like new fashion  
I like old stories  
Like my sister used to tell  
This is the voice  
This is the picture  
I like romantics  
But I don't like Steven  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn  
  
I like the welcome  
I like my sunbed  
But it burns me alive  
I like old heroes  
I like old film stars  
Dirty pictures, snap snap  
I like intrusion  
When she's dressed in white  
A nervous bride  
I don't remember  
If she's black or white  
This is the heart  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn  
  
This could be it  
This could be nothing  
Will you remember  
When the sparkle dies down  
I like Ferraris  
I like the fame  
Appreciation in the strangest ways  
I could believe  
In such things for now  
Don't like to crash, climb, climb  
I like the dancer  
Like you're supposed to  
I'll keep my mouth shut  
But I don't like this  
  
Old men love war songs  
Love Vera Lynn  
Old men love war songs  
Now I'm Vera Lynn

"
1215,Gary Numan,Warriors,"I fall  
Down  
No control somehow  
  
No help  
Now  
My favour slides  
  
No one comes  
Here  
Now I'm feeding strangers  
  
Thin air  
Like cold death  
Here in my heart  
  
I fell for so long for you all  
I fell for so long for you  
I fell for so long for you  
  
Come in  
I'm the ghost  
Of the white faced clown  
  
She's gone  
Gone. I won't look back  
She's gone  
  
I'm old  
So old  
This infection of time  
  
My skin  
Age  
Shows no kindness to me  
  
I fell for so long for you all  
I fell for so long for you  
I fell for so long for you

"
1216,Gary Numan,We Are Glass,"We are young we can break  
Watch us fall  
We can take some train  
Down to the sea  
We are glass, we are glass  
We are real you can touch  
Just for now  
And then say  
'Hey you, which way is down'  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We are strong we run though  
We have time  
And to you I'm just  
One of those boys  
We are glass, we are glass  
We are cold  
We're not supposed to cry  
But it's all just a thought  
So here am I  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
They run fast  
Impressions of the floors inviting  
Stay with me, stay with me  
They run past  
With telephones they scream  
Well would you turn all this down  
Turn all this down  
  
You are replaced you are you  
And our dreams are real  
And dreams are all we need  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
We slip down  
And old eyes don't cry for me  
'Cause I doubt I'm and I doubt you  
And never never going to doubt  
We are glass, we are glass  
  
They run fast  
Impressions of the floors inviting  
Stay with me, stay with me  
They run past  
With telephones they scream  
Well would you turn all this down  
Turn all this down

"
1217,Gary Numan,We Are So Fragile,"We are so fragile  
Advertising lies  
That are whiter than yours  
We are so fragile  
They could give us a war  
Just to keep us amused  
  
We are so fragile  
I could stay here inside  
And say 'It's all been done'  
We are so fragile  
Just pretend I never tried  
I'll leave up to you  
  
We are still so young  
And it must be wrong  
But I'll do it all the same  
We are really so shy  
There's nothing I can do  
Except believe in you  
  
We could always go home  
But everyone says  
This is the place to be  
We are so unnatural  
But you wouldn't understand  
You only deal with men

"
1218,Gary Numan,We Have A Technical,"We have a random on the westside  
Personality malfunction  
He says I can't give you anything at all  
Just a room with a bad view of you  
  
He sent a letter to a downstat  
Saying sorry that I missed you  
But I can't think of anything to do  
He's addicted to the time track  
  
We have a technical  
We have a technical  
  
He's in a hotel where they all go  
Saying me, I've lost my memory  
It's so surprising  
Just how quickly things can end  
  
Like a hero on a platform of friends  
This table is so crowded  
With people that I don't know  
And I never really turn  
  
My thoughts on you  
So the image breaks down again  
  
We have a technical  
We have a technical  
  
I suppose it's very shady  
At least until the lights go out  
Advertising posters on the wall  
And the young ones singing softly  
  
Do they ever come back  
Or is it always at the wrong time  
I could crawl around the floor  
Just like I'm real  
And move a hand in front of my eyes  
  
We have a technical  
We have a technical

"
1219,Gary Numan,We Need It,"We are not  
What you've been waiting for  
We are not  
The things you need  
We are not  
Softly singing love songs  
All we are  
Here for is right  
Room for one more  
Here in this room  
We play games  
Room for one more  
Here in this room  
You can feel it all  
We need it  
To keep the shakes away  
We need it  
To help us breathe  
We need it  
For everything we feel  
We need it  
Like we need you  
-repeat chorus-  
We break down  
Start up the smile I suppose  
You learn quick  
You learn nothing  
One more girl  
Just leaves us wanting more  
This young love  
Just leaves us cold  
-repeat chorus-  

"
1220,Gary Numan,Welcome To Love,"I could talk of memories  
I could talk of miracles  
I can't talk of anything but you  
I remember everything  
Even how you laughed at me  
I remember every word you said  
'Love is a game  
Love is a game that we play  
Love is a game  
Love is a game and you lose  
Welcome to Love'  
Now you're waiting for someone  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
And I wonder who you're waiting for  
There is nothing I can say  
There are no good words for this  
There is nothing more that I can do  
'Lovers are fools  
Lovers are foolish in the dark  
Lovers are fools  
Lovers are foolish and blind  
Welcome to Love'

1221,Gary Numan,"When The Sky Bleeds, He Will Come","I thought I heard someone crying, thought I heard someone crying  
And I thought it was me  
I thought I heard someone screaming, thought I heard someone screaming  
  
I bleed for you. I bleed for, I bleed for  
I, I, I need something to live for  
Is this the end we're deserving?  
I, I, I need something to live for  
I'm on my knees and I'm begging  
  
Something's fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I don't believe it  
Fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to save me  
I don't believe it  
  
I thought I saw the sky bleeding, thought I saw the sky bleeding  
And I thought I saw you  
I thought I saw oceans burning, thought I saw oceans burning  
And I thought I saw you  
  
I thought I saw angels falling  
Beautiful, but still falling down  
I bleed for you  
I bleed for  
I bleed for  
  
I, I, I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you betray me?  
I, I, I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you repay me?  
  
Something's falling from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I don't believe it  
Falling from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to take me  
I don't believe it

1222,Howard Jones,Always Asking Questions,"We all want peace we don't want misery  
So many of us won't let us be these things  
But we only are confused  
We feel stronger as we grow older  
But still we feel bemused  
  
Always asking questions  
We're always asking questions  
  
And the temptation is to just step back  
Well we give what we lack  
We will always be asking questions  
Why rich?  
Why poor?  
  
Always asking questions  
We're always asking questions  
  
Why this?  
Why that?  
We're always asking questions  
Why this?  
Why that?  
Always asking  
Don't stop asking  
  
Don't stop asking questions  
Always asking questions  
  
In answer to this question is just shut up  
You don't know  
I don't know  
Nobody knows  
This is an answer to every question  
This is a place to begin  
  
Always asking questions  
Always asking questions  
  
Why this?  
Why that?  
Why this?  
Why that?

1223,Howard Jones,ANGELS AND LOVERS,"There's a whisper on the wind tonight  
It tells me what the angels and lovers said  
This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
You find a love like this once in your life  
A diamond in your hand not a piece of glass  
Picture you  
Looking back on what you've  
Done to lose all this time  
  
If the moon should turn red over your head don't let her go  
If the sea should turn dry don't let him fly don't say goodbye  
If the planets collide don't run and hide change his mind  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find  
  
This desire  
Is not ordinary  
Love is screaming at you

If the planets collide don't run and hide change his mind  
Just believe it's your time here is the sign what angels and lovers find

"
1224,Howard Jones,Another Chance,"So we're lookin' out on the world and what do we see  
Another screen full of horror, another atrocity,  
What can I do as simple man who wants to make a difference,  
Wants to do what he can, not just talk about it.  
  
Stone drops in a pond, stirs the sediment, sends ripples, to the edge of the
world,  
  
A teenage boy with a rubber band around his arm, finds a vein and a back road
into the dark and stops the pain.  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again  
  
A young woman with a deadly belt around her waist,  
Steps on the bus with no regret for her life and the lives she will take,  
A leader in the rapture of his absolute right will not connect with a young
man wrapped in the flag, in a black bag.  
  
Voice raised in a room of silence, conquers fear, takes action, starts the
journey, starts the journey  
  
Baby born with an open mind and a trusting face has no regard for distinction,
says to have hope is to be human  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day  
Another chance, another day  
to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day  
Another chance, another day  
to mend, to change, to start again  
  
Another chance, another day to mend, to change, to start again

"
1225,Howard Jones,Back In Your Life,"Soon the warm night breezes roll on in  
A steamy blanket for the shore  
This is streetlight time  
You said you were mine  
So the fool believes  
What the night conceives  
The light of love is in your eyes  
Is in your smile again  
Is in your life again  
Was a time when love grew cold for you  
Turned your back on memories  
I was there for you  
I will see you through  
Darkest hours fade  
The promises we made  
Were not the kind to fade away  
We'll face another day  
We'll face another day  
When that was yesterday  
Will the ocean rollers bring you home  
Or will they take you out to sea  
This is real-time  
And you are still mine  
The fool that loves his dreams  
Breaks the cruelest schemes  
The light of love is in your eyes  
Is in your smile again  
Is in your life again  
Back in your smile again  
Back in your life again

1226,Howard Jones,Brutality Of Fact,"Last of the trouble has followed through  
This [?] your potential to  
I've seen your lifeline go out to you  
Sidestepping our convention  
  
But you always managed to find a way  
To avoid what the negative people say  
The sun will shine on a brighter day  
Stick to your own potential  
  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
  
A waking Earth is calling you  
Drive all night, you can't sit still  
Here comes the torment that eats inside  
[?] those who wish you well  
  
The callings strong but how can you hear  
Receivers dead, the transmissions clear  
The Moon will rise in your finest hour  
Lighting our potential  
  
Caught in perversion of our Human life  
Fall in confusion born of sacrifice  
  
But you always managed to find a way  
To avoid what the negative people say  
The sun will shine on a brighter day  
When you stick to your own potential  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
Failure!

Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
Failure!  
  
(Spoken)  
[?] to make a life, Beckon it  
Bodies of great beauty could not surrender  
Their rationality fading in [?]  
The security of sensation  
  
A historic harlequin [?] harks a mild  
The spirit of radio mortgage  
Holding their pre selection  
In the brutality of fact

There's a person that I know  
OK its you and me  
Keeps coming up against a brick wall  
Always blaming and complaining but sustaining  
While their luck doesn't change at all  
Obstacles and ridicule  
Are common in his head  
Does he even listen

Take the time to listen to the collective heartbeats

1228,Howard Jones,Conditioning,"Well you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Well we think that you are john or dave  
But you're not, you're not who you think you are  
Jumbled mass of preconceived ideas  
  
From our birth we were given an identity  
People told us we were great or small  
From our birth we were given rules of right or wrong  
Not forgetting the bullies at school  
  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
The world teaches us to think that life is full of limitations  
The world tries to make us think that there are loads of limits  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning  
  
And as the world makes us feel great  
And as the world makes us feel small  
Oh so convinced of our identity  
If we only knew it we just can't believe it we just won't believe it  
  
Leading us to think that we are such a success  
Conning us to think that we are just a failure  
Leading us to think that we are so intelligent  
Conning us to think that we are just a do-do do-do  
  
Welcome to conditioning  
Welcome to conditioning

1229,Howard Jones,Cookin' In The Kitchen,"I met an alien one night while I was walking after dark  
He said don't be afraid I've come to know I've come to make my mark  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
He said why are these men and women lying here just on the street  
He said why are these children dying 'cause' they have no food to eat  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
Why are these people hating others for the colour of their skin  
Why are your brother creatures murdered for the flesh that lies within  
Don't lose the rage, don't become immune  
When others criticise you  
Don't change your tune  
You've got to love, with a passion that hurts  
It's love that conquers baby  
Its love that serves  
And in the moment before you go to sleep  
You can turn on me I'm the blue light wrap me round you  
And when the world turns it's coldest shoulder  
In the name of all that's good  
And there's a road, and it's very long  
And you gotta be sweet baby  
And you gotta be strong  
And I'll be there, to dry your tears  
And I'll be cooking in your kitchen  
Food for everyone  
And ill be working in the backroom  
Help for everyone  

"
1230,Howard Jones,Cross That Line,"It's not my fault if you didn't live out your  
Youthful dreams  
Now you want to backtrack, how different it all seems  
Love seems to be like alcohol, evaporates before your eyes  
The bonds that once were welcome, become the chains we despise  
Chorus  
When you cross that line, there's no turning back  
When you cross that line, don't come knocking at my door  
Everyone has got to take some responsibility  
The grass is rarely bluer, but you wouldn't take it from me  
Finding out the hard way can be an endless affair  
I'd stop you if I could, but then again, I wouldn't dare  
I'm telling you when I say these words, that  
They're not spoken in bitterness  
That destructive emotion has long ago left  
And these tears that cleanse the soul and let me  
Start afresh  
When you cross that line, what more can I say  
When you cross that line, we are no more  
We are no more  

"
1231,Howard Jones,Dig This Well Deep,"With one thing and another  
Banged my head against the wall  
Always looking over my shoulder  
And it makes no sense at all  
Chorus  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
It's a promise I must keep  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
'cause I want to find water  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
Going to sow before I reap  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
'cause I want to find water  
Cynics try to hold me in the graveyard of their egos  
Put my dreams out with the trashman and they left me on a plateau  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are walking on a tightrope  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are wilted down to your last last hope  
See it through to a conclusion even if it leads to nowhere  
Sometimes there is no solution but the water tastes as good there  

"
1232,Howard Jones,Don't Always Look At The Rain,"Some people I know have given up on their lives  
Drowning their sorrows, and mumblin', and forgot the fight  
We can tip the balance we can break those barriers down  
Little things count as much as the big and turn it all around  
  
And it's oh, don't always look at the rain  
No, don't look at the rain  
  
Some people I know have lost their feel for mystery  
They say everything has got to be proved, this isn't a nursery  
And joseph who's five years old, stops fights in his playground yard  
No more fights and bigotry, oh is it so hard  
  
And it's oh, don't always look at the rain  
No, don't always look at the rain  
Ha, don't always look at the rain  
  
And tell me, is it a crime to have an ideal or two  
Evolving takes it's time, we can't do it all in one go  
Doesn't have to drive us all mad, we can only do our best  
Let the mind shut up, and the heart do the rest

"
1233,Howard Jones,Don't Put These Curses On Me,"Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
  
Don't curse me with the love of money  
It will burn me up and waste my time  
Don't curse me with the love of intellect

You know more than I do

Don't put these curses on  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
  
Don't curse me with the idea  
That work is good and holy  
It only took you to the grave with a bitter heart  
Don't curse me with this patriotic love  
Of parents, ideas, country and wife  
You invite war into your home  
  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on  
Don't put these curses on me oh no you don't  
Don't put these curses on

1235,Howard Jones,Elegy,"Please don't look at me this way  
I am from the same seed as you  
Take me back to the womb  
I am weary of this life  
  
Don't believe in my eyes  
Don't believe in my mind  
Don't believe in right or wrong  
Don't believe in cruel or kind  
  
But all this talk is only poetry  
Only as true as we would believe  
We must live to fight the negative  
Not to court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh  
In defeat oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh the pain of life is sweet  
Is it wrong to long for death?  
Must I cling to the thrills of life  
Ash to ash and dust to dust  
  
But all this talk is only poetry  
Only as true as we would believe  
We must live to fight the negative  
Not court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh

Take us forward through the tomb  
There's no finish to a life

1236,Howard Jones,Equality,"Everybody wants to feel happy, even if you think that you don't  
Everyone wants to know the secret, even if you think that you don't  
Everybody thinks they're different from the next man now  
But we just got to realize we're just the same  
  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there will always appear to be someone worse  
You know there'll always appear to be someone better  
You know there'll always appear to be someone worse, oh  
  
Everyone has got their character  
Everyone has got their personality  
But the longing is still the same  
So what is the answer by easy on yourself  
Make yourself feel at ease maybe that's the answer  
  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there will always appear to be someone worse  
Always appear to be someone better  
You know there'll always appear to be someone worse, oh  
  
We're just the same don't you know  
We're just the same don't you know  
Looking over there

But we're just the same, don't you know  
We're just the same, don't you know  
We're just the same

1237,Howard Jones,Everlasting Love,"He wasn't looking for a pretty face  
She wasn't searching for the latest style  
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV  
She needed someone with an interior smile  
  
She wasn't looking for a cuddle in the back seat  
He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill  
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week  
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill  
  
I need an everlasting love  
I need a friend and a lover divine  
An everlasting precious love  
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time  
  
Back in the world of disposable emotion  
In the climate of temporary dreams  
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost  
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams  
  
This is love worth waiting for  
Something special, something pure  
  
This is love worth waiting for  
Bitterness will die for sure  
Something special, something pure  
This is love worth waiting for.

Let it be your friend  
Don't be scared of what you'll find  
Let's not pretend  
  
Say it isn't true  
You gave up on your dream  
Blinded by the spotlight  
Falling through the screen  
  
You got to be strong  
You go to fight on  
For everyone  
  
Hold a mirror to your life  
Polish night and day  
You can find the clear blue sky  
When the tarnish scrapes away  
  
Hold on a minute  
Let me be your friend  
Strict as you want it  
Or gently take the bends  
  
You got to be strong  
You go to fight on  
For everyone  
  
There are times when the snowstorm hits  
And everything becomes a blur of cold and white  
Then you know that you must fight  
And believe that mountains shift  
And when the snowstorm lifts  
You'll see the sun and the moon so clear

Little scars on the brain

Makes my body ill  
Stops me reaching the heights

Weightless in the air

Leaves scars on the brain

The world is peopled by many winds  
Whirling faster than the wind  
Solving a dilemma of life and death  
Trying to make some sense of it all  
No good blaming the outside world  
Pleasure and pain are in the mind

Play it straight or in disguise

1244,Howard Jones,Gun Turned On The World,"You're walkin' 'round like a doll without a head  
You should be thinking 'bout how to give your love instead  
I've seen you lying and cheating your way  
Then you complain about what all of your friends say  
You shoot your mouth like you damn well own the world  
We always have to keep our little white flags unfurled  
Just try to finish the things that you start  
Stop thinking with your fists  
And start thinking with your heart  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Things have to be attempted one step at a time  
You got to take that poison from your eyes  
You know the lights are going out in your life  
Your killing yourself with your own knife  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
You don't want a love you need a chaperone  
You want a first-class alibi  
You bore the pants off people on the telephone  
People are sick of your lies  
You better open your eyes  
You're like a gun turned on the world, like a gun  
You're takin' one step forward then two steps back  
Friendly advice gets treated like a heart attack  
You can drown in the shallow water of hate  
Get the sense before it's too late now  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world

1245,Howard Jones,Hide And Seek,"There was a time when there was nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Just a distant hum.  
There was a being and he lived on his own  
He had nd one to talk to and nothing to do.  
He drew up the plans  
Learnt to work with his hands  
  
A million years passed by and his work was done.  
And his words where these:  
Hope you find it in everything  
  
Everything that you see  
  
Hope you find it in everything  
  
Everything that you see  
  
Hope you find it  
Hope you find it  
  
Hope you find me in you.  
So she had built her  
Elaborate home with it's ups and  
It's downs  
It's rain and it's sun.  
She decided that her work  
It was done  
Time to have fun  
  
And found a game to play.  
Then as part of the game  
  
She completely forgot  
Where she'd hidden herself  
And she spent the rest of her time  
Trying to find the parts.  
  
Hope you find it in everything  
Everything that you see  
...  
There was a time when there was nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Just a distant hum.

1246,Howard Jones,Human's Lib,"Sometimes I'd like to go to bed  
With a hundred women or men  
And lose my mind in lust and drink  
And to hit some people into feeling good, oh  
  
Sometimes I'd like to dance in the street  
Don't wanna go to work, just wanna lay in bed all day  
  
Why don't you then  
Why don't you then  
  
Life just seems oh so meaningless  
And who can blame us for wanting these things  
But you just try being free my friend  
And everyone will hate your guts, I only want to free

1247,Howard Jones,Hunger For The Flesh,"Spare a thought for the souls  
Who cannot leave this earth  
The attachments bind so tightly, not a chance  
Not a chance of a new birth  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprisoned themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Wishing to hold onto life and all it's games  
Singing their lament song  
Holding back the change  
They came here for to dance  
To learn and not to cling  
Holding onto life  
As if it were the important thing  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprison themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Let them have a new start  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Holding back the change

1248,Howard Jones,Hunt The Self,"Messing around I've wasted my time for years  
Listening to friends who keep filling me up with ideas

Hearing this sham is like getting drunk on cheap wine  
  
Well it's time for a change  
I've got to move on  
There's got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong  
  
Look in better places gonna look inside  
Gonna get higher something is pulling me on  
Breaking down the old ways feeling no regret  
Gone are the shaky sands I've been building on  
  
Well it's time for a change  
Well I've lost lots of friends  
I've got to move on  
By sticking to my ground  
There's got to be more than this  
I don't give a damn  
The feeling is strong  
Just look what I've found  
  
Here I come now got no time to frown  
Nothing in my way now nothing can bring me down  
Feel that surge open the doors around  
Higher and higher the world is my hunting ground

I've got to move on  
There's got to be more than this  
The feeling is strong

If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
You never see the sun  
You're never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
You'll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
Chorus  
Try to build a house on top of the highest tree  
It's dangerous and a bit risky  
But what about the view  
See the clouds and the mountains too  
Chorus  
Get your hands dirty  
Get a little insane  
Come out and play with me  
Barefoot in the rain  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth  
(you see the sun and then you see the rain)  
You never see the sun  
You're never gonna feel the rain  
With your life under glass  
In the middle lane  
You'll never feel the joy  
Never feel the pain  
If you love  
You know you're gonna feel the hurt  
(feel the joy, feel the pain)  
See the flowers  
Growin' from the muddy earth

Growin' from the muddy earth

This dream's in sight  
You've got to admit it  
At this point in time that it's clear  
The future looks bright  
On that train all graphite and glitter  
Undersea by rail  
Ninety minutes from new york to paris  
Well by seventy-six we'll be A. O. K.

What a beautiful world this will be  
What a glorious time to be free  
  
Get your ticket to that wheel in space  
While there's time  
The fix is in  
You'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky  
You know we've got to win  
Here at home we'll play in the city  
Powered by the sun  
Perfect weather for a streamlined world  
There'll be spandex jackets for everyone  
  
On that train all graphite a glitter  
Undersea by rail  
Ninety minutes from new york to paris  
(more leisure for artists everywhere)  
A just machine to make big decisions  
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision  
We'll be clean when their work is done  
We'll be eternally free yes and eternally young

1253,Howard Jones,Is There A Difference?,"Is there a difference between yes and no  
Is there a difference between up and down  
Must I fear what others fear  
What nonsense  
  
Some people are content  
Enjoying things that belong to tradition  
With the seasons they cast their lot  
Without a question  
  
Other men are clear and bright and solid  
Other men are sharp and clever and jolly  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh oh wo  
  
Is there a difference between high and low  
Is there a difference between then and now  
Do we have to live in pain and fear  
What nonsense  
  
People are drifting like the waves on the sea  
Without direction like the restless wind  
Not knowing forward not knowing back  
Just existing  
  
Other men are strong and full of courage  
Other men are witty and full of knowledge  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh wo  
  
Other men are clear and bright and solid  
I alone am drifting on the sea  
Other men are sharp and clever and jolly  
Restless like the wind  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh wo  
  
Is there a difference  
Is there really a difference  
Yes and no  
Is there a difference  
Up and down  
Is there a difference  
High and low  
Is there a difference  
Then and now  
Is there a difference  
Yes and no  
Is there a difference  
Up and down  
Is there a difference

1254,Howard Jones,It Just Doesn't Matter,"Matter matter oh no no  
  
If i haven't got any friends  
It just doesn't matter  
If nobody understands well  
It just doesn't matter  
If Im not good to anyone  
It just doesn't matter  
If Im completely alone  
It just doesn't matter  
  
If I've been misunderstood  
It just doesn't matter  
My best friends think Im no good  
It just doesn't matter  
If my horoscope looks bad  
It just doesn't matter  
My girlfriend even thinks Im mad  
It just doesn't matter  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
If my world falls apart  
It just doesn't matter  
I'll pick it up right from the start  
It just doesn't matter  
(?) Me up  
It just doesn't matter  
My children have had enough  
It just doesn't matter  
  
Matter matter oh no no

1255,Howard Jones,Kev's Song,"Did we fail to see you crumble  
Did we watch you fade to black  
Jaw hanging brain aching no one can handle  
Did we forget?  
To understand  
Did you have it planned?  
We all thought that we knew you so well  
  
So much love to give and take  
Many dreams and plans to make  
Can't believe it we knew you so well  
  
Hardly bare to think what you went through  
As your feet fell through the air  
Hanging in a void of hopeless darkness  
Way beyond despair  
But you made us doubt  
We would've heard your cry  
Of desolation  
We went there as well  
  
So much love to give and take  
Must go on to celebrate  
What you gave us  
You knew us so well  
  
Rippling through a generation  
Aftershocks for years to come  
The angry final step is taken  
Never to be undone  
On the other side  
Was a wave to ride  
Through the storm cloud  
To bring you to shore  
  
So much love to give and take  
Must go on to celebrate  
What you gave us  
You knew us so well

Together we can wipe away the tear

Just want to simply say  
Won't let you slip away  
  
People want to talk about the future  
Don't want to linger on the past  
Just want to reach to the real you inside  
Forget cold glances and rejections  
Leave the things that separate  
Build on a trust that we can stand on  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Finding all are insecure  
Opening the same door  
Leaving out a stubborn pride  
Seeing from another side

Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together

1258,Howard Jones,Love Is A Good Thing,"We stay up late  
We get no sleep  
My body's aching  
I got no money left  
My friends say I'm loosing it  
You so bad for me  
But that's a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
  
Every room we're in  
Gets trashed from floor to ceiling  
Your kiss is killing me  
When I part from your sweet lips  
My dreams of you are censored  
Restless end in sight  
But that's a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
Love is a good thing  
  
The first law of love  
Is all the rules could be re written  
The second law of love  
Is just what we make it

1259,Howard Jones,Natural,"Everything around is natural don't fight it  
Don't disagree with this and that, no  
Astrology, evolution, this-and-that-ity  
This religion and that, no  
  
Chorus  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well don't you think they wouldn't be  
And if they were not meant to be  
Well don't you think they wouldn't be, oh  
  
Your beliefs, philosophy, don't give us peace  
Destruction of our enemy does it make us right  
And if you took them apart and destroyed them all now one by one  
This still won't make it work, no  
  
Everything we like and don't like is whole and natural  
I know is doesn't feel like it and the world seems wrong  
But if we don't like it now then who can we blame  
Blame god, be still, find harmony

1260,Howard Jones,New Song,"I've been waiting for so long  
To come here now and sing this song  
Don't be fooled by what you see  
Don't be fooled by what you hear  
  
This is a song to all my friends  
They take the challenge to their hearts  
Challenging preconceived ideas  
Saying goodbye to long standing fears  
  
Don't crack up, bend your brain, see both sides  
Throw off your mental chains  
  
I don't want to be hip and cool  
I don't want to play by the rules  
Not under the thumb of the cynical few  
Or laden down by the doom crew

Take this weight from tired shoulders  
Kiss me tenderly  
Let me drown in waves of your love  
You part the trees so I  
Can cherish things that matter  
Your single voice sounds through  
A room of din and chatter  
Oh take me home  
When the streetlights shine above  
Safe in your arms  
So simple to me  
Safe in your arms  
Oh so temporary  
Safe in you arms  
Oh so tenderly  
Not one of the lonely tonight  
Flying hectically  
Through a cloud of buts and maybes  
Passing frantically  
Over nights and days unended  
You turn my head and laugh  
When my world turns sour  
You give me strength to pass  
Through my darkest hour  
Oh take me home  
When the streetlights shine above

What steals the force from your life  
What holds us ransom tonight

This is the greatest day of your life  
If you make it  
And the old spells you know  
They can be broken  
Nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear

The grandest problems defeated  
Impossible choices completed  
Infinite pain will be treated

On potential's hands

And we made it  
And the old spells you know  
'cause they can be broken  
Nothing to fear

This is the greatest day of your life  
And we've made it  
Break the old spells

Break the old spells and throw them away

Hold on for me  
Believe my alibi  
Keep strong  
Don't set me free  
Well this weakness makes me wrong  
I'll show you I can be strong  
And this time it is for real

Is heaven's grace too good for me

Loosin' track, of my mind

Will step out to meet the sun

1264,Howard Jones,Power Of The Media,"Flying through the airwaves  
Living through the printed word  
Flasher in the living room  
Guru of the seen and heard  
Who decides what we get to hear  
Fuzzy round the edges or making it clear  
Blinding us with those facts  
Chorus  
The power of the media will make up our minds  
The power of the media will take down our minds  
Written on the black and white page  
We can't believe what we read  
Tarting up reality has become the new rage  
Who said the truth is stranger than fiction  
A few white lies for a nice little sensation  
Buy up a paper you can influence the nation  
Little box in the corner  
A picture worth a thousand words  
But who chooses which pictures we see  
Who decides on the commentary  
Keeping people in a state of confusion  
There's a thin line between facts and illusion  
Diverting our attention from big brother in the city  
When will we get to the real nitty gritty  

"
1265,Howard Jones,Powerhouse,"You have been a healer, makin' me well  
You have been my talker, givin' my ego hell  
You came and settled me down, when my lights were so dim  
You made me go on when I felt like givin' in  
  
You have been my fire to warm this heart of stone  
You stopped me from feelin' lost and on my own  
You must have been through college, got a lovin' degree  
You ripped away my mental chains and set this poor boy free  
  
You are a powerhouse of energy  
You are a powerhouse of love  
Dealin' with what's right in front of you  
Your are a powerhouse of love  
  
When I was in pain, lyin' in my troubled bed  
You would be my jester, makin' me laugh instead  
You've been my guiding light and you have turned the switch on  
You made me see positive when my whole damn world went wrong  
  
You are a powerhouse of energy  
You are a powerhouse of love  
Dealin' with what's right in front of you  
You are a powerhouse of love

For people round the world  
Feel uneasy now about the future  
Time to end the war against humanity  
Time to build the peace

This here road leads to Cairo

I got to go back  
Go back to my children  
I got to see my little bride

Gone a long long time  
Don't know what I'll find  
Scared of what I'll find  
But I just got to see them again  
  
Hey thanks for stoppin'  
Are you headed down to Cairo?  
I wrecked my Lincoln in Saint Jo  
Why to little old Cairo?  
No special reason  
Look up some folks I used to know  
  
Me I travel some  
Have my share of fun  
Now that's a life a man can live  
Sure I've played and lost  
But who minds the cost  
You got to take more than you give  
  
Hey you got another cigar?  
Son I sure like this car  
Oh from your daddy as a gift  
Say on second thought  
There's gifts I haven't bought  
Just drop me here  
Thanks for the lift  
  
Yes I've travelled some  
Yes I've been a bum  
Never have a dime for gin  
Left to make my way  
Told her I can't stay  
To see my children poor as sin  
  
I know this road  
It leads straight into Cairo  
Twenty-two miles straight ahead  
I can't I can't walk down this road to Cairo  
They're better thinkin' I'm dead

Gone a long long time  
Don't know what I'd find  
Scared of what I'd find  
I can't I just can't walk down this road

1269,Howard Jones,Show Me,"We got the same beat runnin' round  
Through this crazy town  
Oh I'm sick and I can't hear it anymore  
And when we touched as the blood and the rain  
We'd be shakin' the ground  
She's sick and there's a way to bring her 'round  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
  
The party drags us over the edge to a poison shore  
I can't carry this desire anymore  
Across the blue sky callin' me with the sweetest demand  
She talks to me of mercy make me understand  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for

And the world will never know  
  
And through these years  
As the tears chase the rain  
The picture has cleared  
Can we face the change  
  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
The voices may not rise again  
And the world will never know  
Show me what you're waitin' for  
This moment may not rise again  
And your heart will never know

1271,Howard Jones,Tears To Tell,"The time has come to watch you go watch you go  
We weathered rough storms together  
Couldn't conceive of the end  
When I heard of your leavin'  
It came as a shock and surprise  
Like the deepest kinds of love  
Lost on the inside  
Locked right on the inside  
  
What is the greatest expression of love,  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
  
I couldn't be the one to hold you stop you go  
It is like stripping the soul  
Letting all the finest pieces go  
You know these feelings between us  
Could not be expressed  
You will never know my old secrets  
They are so deeply felt they are so deeply felt  
  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings have left me  
What is the greatest expression of love,  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
  
Leaving me with my anecdoted and private jokes  
The memory of a friend  
You don't seem to know my old secrets  
They are so deeply felt they are so deeply felt  
  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings have left me  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell

1272,Howard Jones,The Balance Of Love,"Price of your love's too much to pay  
I'll save myself for another day  
You want my love but you don't want me  
You sell your goods with no guarantee  
You're taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
There's more to me than this double bed  
  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up of empty promises  
I won't let the grass grow under my feet  
I've done my best to make our song complete  
  
Your interest rate is much too low  
You think that I've no life of my own  
The days have gone for your macho values  
I won't be walking in your shadows  
You're taxing me at your highest rate  
You want my heart served on a plate  
The balance of love is in the red  
There's more to me than this double bed  
  
Plenty of fish are left in the sea  
I seem to have picked a shark for me  
The balance of love is now in the red  
I'm fed up with the empty things you said  
  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take  
Must stop messing up me life make no mistake  
It's as if you've never heard of give and take

1273,Howard Jones,The Presence Of Other,"This time, it's different  
Be sure, I mean it  
Can't go on trading on ideas that I just don't own  
A life with some meaning, a life with some sense  
I want, to blame you  
Give you, my power  
I keep it all on the inside, keep it locked in the dark  
I keep it all on the inside, keep it locked in the dark  
People telling me it's not my responsibility  
But it is my problem and it's my life, my life  
I must believe the solutions, to the problems, are in my hands  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
Slow down, just talk  
Sit down, right here  
Must be an answer to the question of birth and death  
A world with some meaning  
A world with some peace  
Inside, it's turbulent, outside, reflects it  
Hear you knockin' on the inside  
Hear me breathe answer please  
Hear you knockin' on the inside  
Hear you breathe answer me  
People telling me what they think that I should be  
Only thing that I can be is myself, myself  
I must believe in my choices to create value out of everything  
  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it presents  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
Feel the presence of other  
Love the resistance it offers  
Different from and outside of me  
Pushing me to find what is self  
  
This time, it's different  
I'm sure I mean it  
Slow down, just listen  
It's my life, it's my life

1274,Howard Jones,Wanders To You,"It's been so long since I slept  
The good book at bedtime no longer suffices  
The bottle of whiskey just one of my vices  
It might help me to sleep  
There you are with your golden brown skin  
The sparkling pacifico catching your chin  
The salt on your marguerita will stick to your lips  
Lips that I'd die for a fleeting stolen kiss  
  
My mind wanders to you and things that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
  
You couldn't live with someone in dreamland  
Toothpaste from harrods when the corner shop will do  
A friend giving a lift becomes a chauffeur for two  
The grandest illusions to hang on to  
There you are with your golden brown skin  
The sparkling pacifico catching your chin  
The salt on your marguerita will stick to your lips  
Lips that I'd die for a fleeting stolen kiss  
  
My mind wanders to you and things that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
Wanders to you and the things that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
  
(come with me)  
(wander with me)  
  
There you are with your london grey skin  
The light from the streetlamp corrupting your chin  
The cream from a guinness lingers on your lips  
Lips that would beg for a meaningful kiss  
  
My mind wanders to you and all that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
Wanders to you and all that we might do  
But you're just another illusion  
My mind wanders to you  
Wanders to you  
Wanders to you

1275,Howard Jones,What Can I Say?,"Questions on how you'd like to meet Jesus  
Or how you'd like to live with him  
Some people follow gurus  
Search truth and knowledge  
Some people don't want any religion in their life  
They just want to feel ok  
  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in the world  
Who like to see peace in the world  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in the world  
Who like to see peace in the world  
  
Some people want to get on the council  
Improve the environment  
Some people want be members of parliament  
And improve the country  
Some people want be anarchists  
And improve the whole world, Oh ohh ohh  
  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in this world  
Who like to see peace in this world  
So far history is full of great people  
Who like to see peace in the world  
Who like to see peace in the world  
  
But there isn't any peace, anywhere, really  
Everyone and everything is in a hopeless mess  
Arguing and fighting  
Everyone and everything is in a hopeless mess  
Arguing and fighting  
So what can we do about it  
  
How about doing more listening than talking  
Giving everyone the benefit of the doubt  
People say give and take  
Why can't we give and give  
People say give and take  
Why can't we give and give  
  
This isn't exactly going to bring about peace in the world  
But it's something  
But it's something  
And we will probably still have a bad time

1276,Howard Jones,What Is Love?,"I love you whether or not you love me  
I love you even if you think that I don't  
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you, but I don't mind  
Why should I mind, why should I mind  
  
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway  
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway  
  
Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear  
Never worry never be sad  
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can  
This is why I don't mind you doubting  
  
And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be  
The door always must be left unlocked  
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you  
And not to spend the time just doubting

"
1277,Howard Jones,Where Are We Going?,"Restraints were hoisted on at such an early age  
Straps were tightened in the class  
Scripts by the school sage  
Putting out the spark  
Left us in the dark  
  
Possibilities shut right down  
The cleaver of the uniform was handed down  
Treated like a clown  
  
Where are we going  
Where are we going  
What are we doing  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
Throwing is away  
All that potential  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that  
  
We will refuse to be your clones or  
Work in someone's scheme  
Let a person find themselves not be part  
Of a machine that worships power and wealth  
We need our sanity  
A day will come when everyone will have  
Their due respect  
Hate will no longer be a twisted form of love  
  
Where are we going  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that  
  
Tell me where are we going  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that

1278,Howard Jones,Why Look For The Key,"And they made the secret pact  
His knowledge would be tapped  
The link was based on a respect  
On their lives they would reflect  
A perfect state of non-attachment  
Was striven for and claimed as fact  
The younger grew and learnt his lesson well  
All his ideals were intact  
Why look for the key in another  
The answer lay in his own heart  
Won't find yourself in some other  
It always was there right at the start  
But power it corrupted  
That's where attachment starts  
The power had erupted  
The spell will crack  
As each mental bond was broken  
Strength grew in the young man's heart  
What began as love not passion  
Had left a seed in his heart  
Why look for the key in another ...  

"
1279,Howard Jones,You Are Beautiful To Me,"Can't tell you how many times I've wanted to hold you  
Can't tell you how many dreams how many fantasies  
As I count down the hours and I count down the seconds  
Will I be able to say will I be able to say  
You are beautiful to me  
You are sexual to me  
Still a mystery  
You are woman  
Sometimes I wonder if this love will ever find expression  
Does a seed in winters arms know of springs intention  
Two spirits dancing through a body conversation  
Is this light years away will I be able to say  
You are beautiful to me  
You are sexual to me  
Still a mystery  
You are woman  

"
1280,Howard Jones,You Can Say It's All Over,"You took the love I offered  
I tried the life that you lead  
The truth was told and forgiven  
You sold the strength that I need  
  
Now I can see that all you wanted  
Was someone you could hold a mirror to  
This mirror shattered into pieces  
You didn't want to really make things true  
  
And the blame that you offered  
Is something I didn't need  
When the truth beads were counted  
Is it you that I freed  
  
And I can say that it's all over  
And I can say that I don't want it too  
I found that when I'm in your presence  
That I could reach the highest side of you  
  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now  
  
One more chance is what I stopped saying  
A colder place to lay my head  
Now it's over and truth is bragging  
An empty heart and a single bed  
  
And I can say it's all over  
Well you can say that you don't want it too  
I found that now I've lost your presence  
Love doesn't always let you see right through  
  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now  
And you can say it's all over baby  
And you can say it's all over now

1281,Howard Jones,You Know I Love You... Don't You?,"You got the socket and I got the plug  
I am the floor and you are the rug  
I got the rhythm you got the beat  
We feel it shake us from our souls to our feet  
And you know I Love you  
You know I Love you...don't you  
You got the metal and I got the die  
We make a structure that no one can deny  
I need you and you need me  
I need your honey like a flower needs a bee  
You know I Love you  
You know I Love you...don't you  
No one is an island on that you can depend  
A person on his own is a sinking ship  
It will be that way til the time will end  
Now don't you worry when things get tough  
We'll stick together through the smooth and the rough  
Your the steam engine and I am the tracks  
Roll over me I'll be rolling right back 'cause

1282,Howard Jones,You're The Buddha,"There were times when I thought there was nothin' in this world  
There was nothin' in this world for me  
Everywhere I looked there was trouble in my life  
Trouble far as I could see  
Hey there's a man doin' alright  
What's his philosophy?  
He come over here and whispered in my ear  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary  
So who am I so nervous and shy  
To be brilliant and talented  
It's the light not the dark that frightens us most  
And the power lies in our head  
You playin' small doesn't help at all  
The world need the things you give  
Switch yourself on, turn the pressure on  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary  
There are times when I think there's plenty in this world  
There's plenty in this world for me  
Anytime I see trouble in my life  
It becomes an opportunity  
Now there's a chance to make the world dance  
You do it unconsciously  
Help this Winter turn into Spring  
You're the Buddha, you're the Christ,  
You're the Mohammed, and the Mother Mary

1283,Iron Maiden,"22, Acacia Avenue","If you're feeling down depressed and lonely  
I know a place where we can go  
22 Acacia Avenue meet a lady that I know  
So if you're looking for a good time  
And you're prepared to pay the price  
Fifteen quid is all she asks for  
Everybody's got their vice  
  
If you're waiting for a long time for the rest to do their piece  
You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free  
So any time you're down the East End don't you hesitate to go  
You can take my honest word for it she'll teach you more than you can know  
  
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness  
Can't you see it only brings you sadness  
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease  
  
Some day when you're reaching the age of forty  
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying  
Nobody then will want to know  
You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more  
  
22, the avenue that's the place where we all go  
You will find it's warm inside the red light's burning bright tonight  
  
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life  
Don't you ever think about the bad times  
Why do you have to live this way  
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay  
  
Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue  
The way you walk it make men think of having you  
When you're walking down the street  
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you  
  
Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please  
Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees  
Abuse her misuse her she can take all that you've got  
Caress her molest her she always does what you want  
  
You're running away don't you know what you're doing  
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin  
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away  
You believe that because what you're earning  
Your life's good don't you know that you're hurting  
All the people that love you don't cast them aside  
All the men that are constantly drooling  
It's no life for you stop all that screwing  
You're packing your bags and you're coming with me

"
1284,Iron Maiden,2 Am,"I get in from work at 2a.m.  
And sit down with a beer  
Turn on the late night t.v.  
And then wonder why I'm here  
It's meaningless and trivial  
And it washes over me  
And once again I wonder  
Is this all there is for me  
  
Here I am again  
Look at me again  
Here I am again  
On my own  
Trying hard to see  
What there is for me  
Here I am again  
On my own  
  
Life seems so pathetic  
I wish I could live it all behind  
This canvas chair, this bed,  
These walls that fall in on my mind  
Hold on for something better  
That just drags you trough the dirt  
Do you just let go or carry on  
And try to take the hurt

1285,Iron Maiden,2 Minutes To Midnight,"Kill for gain or shoot to maim  
But we don't need a reason  
The Golden Goose is on the loose  
And never out of season  
Some blackened pride still burns inside  
This shell of bloody treason  
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun  
For the love of living death.  
  
[Chorus]  
The killer's breed or the demon's seed,  
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,  
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain,  
But don't you pray for my soul anymore.  
Two minutes to midnight  
The hands that threaten doom.  
Two minutes to midnight  
To kill the unborn in the womb.  
  
The blind men shout let the creatures out  
We'll show the unbelievers  
The napalm screams of human flames  
Of a prime time Belsen feast, yeah!  
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy,  
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two  
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you.  
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song,  
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Midnight, all night

1286,Iron Maiden,Afraid To Shoot Strangers,"Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat  
From my brow  
But it's not the fear 'cause  
I'd rather go now  
  
Trying to visualize the horrors that  
Will lay ahead  
The desert sand mound a burial ground  
  
When it comes to the time  
Are we partners in crime?  
When it comes to the time  
We'll be ready to die  
  
God let us go now and finish what's  
To be done  
Thy Kingdom Come  
Thy shall be done, on earth  
  
Trying to justify to ourselves the  
Reasons to go  
Should we live and let live  
Forget or forgive  
  
But how can we let them go on this way?  
The reign of terror corruption must end  
And we know deep down there's  
No other way  
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say  
  
Afraid to shoot strangers  
Afraid to shoot strangers

1287,Iron Maiden,Alexander The Great,"""My son ask for thyself another  
Kingdom, for that which I leave  
is too small for thee""  
(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)  
  
Near to the east  
In a part of ancient Greece  
In an ancient land called Macedonia  
Was born a son  
To Philip of Macedon  
The legend his name was Alexander  
  
At the age of nineteen  
He became the Macedon King  
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor  
By the Aegian Sea  
In 334 B.C.  
He utterly beat the armies of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men  
  
King Darius the third  
Defeated fled Persia  
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes  
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well  
And he founded the city called Alexandria  
  
By the Tigris river  
He met King Darius again  
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela  
Entering Babylon  
And Susa, treasures he found  
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a God amongst mortal men  
  
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke  
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'  
And legend said that who untied the knot  
He would become the master of Asia  
  
Helonism he spread far and wide  
The Macedonian learned mind  
Their culture was a western way of life  
He paved the way for Christianity  
  
Marching on, marching on  
The battle weary marching side by side  
Alexander's army line by line  
They wouldn't follow him to India  
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory  
  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
He died of fever in Babylon

1290,Iron Maiden,Back In The Village,"Turn the spotlights on the people,  
Switch the dial and eat the worm.  
Take your chances, kill the engine,  
Drop your bombs and let it burn.  
  
White flags shot to ribbons,  
The truce is black and burned,  
Shellshock in the kitchen,  
Tables overturned.  
  
[Chorus]  
Back in the village again,  
In the village.  
I'm back in the village again.  
  
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded,  
I see sixes all the way.  
In a black hole, and I'm spinning  
As my wings get shot away.  
  
No breaks on the inside,  
Paper cats and burning barns,  
There's a fox among the chickens,  
And a killer in the hounds.  
  
Questions are a burden  
And answers are a prison for oneself  
Shellshock in the kitchen  
Tables start to burn.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But still we walk into the valley  
And others try to kill the inner flame  
We're burning brighter than before  
I don't have a number, I'M A NAME!

1291,Iron Maiden,Be Quick Or Be Dead,"Covered in sinners and dripping  
With gilt  
Making you money from slime  
And from filth  
Parading your bellies in ivory towers  
Investing our lives in your schemes  
And your powers  
  
You got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
You've got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
Be quick!  
Or be dead!  
Be quick!  
Or be dead  
  
See, what's ruling all our lives  
See, who's pulling the strings,  
I bet you won't fall on your face,  
Your belly will hold you in place  
  
The serpent is crawling inside of  
Your ear  
He says you must vote for what you  
Want to hear  
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're  
Alright  
So pull yourself stupid and rob  
Yourself blind

1292,Iron Maiden,Blood On The World's Hands,"Sometimes it makes me wonder  
Sometimes it makes me question  
Sometimes it makes me saddened  
Always it makes me angry but  
  
When you can see it happening  
The madness that's all around you  
Nobody seems to worry  
The World seems so powerless to act  
  
It's out of control  
Blood on The World's hands  
Each day a new toll  
  
Another assassination  
The same day a new creation  
But what are they coming into  
Security of a world that brings  
  
One day another killing  
Somewhere there's someone starving  
Another a savage raping  
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us  
  
It's out of control  
Blood on The World's hands  
Each day it goes on  
  
Brutality and aggression  
Tomorrow another lesson  
Expecting another air raid  
Praying for a ceasefire  
  
They say things are getting better  
No need to be complacent  
There's chaos across the border  
And one day it could be happening to us  
  
It's out of control  
Blood in The World's hands  
It's our epitaph  
It's out of control  
Someone should know  
Blood on The World's hands  
  
Someone should

Gonna break down the walls  
Break out of this bad place

Can I play with madness?  
He said you're blind, too blind to see  
  
Said you're too blind to see  
  
I screamed aloud to the old man  
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know  
I say you'll pay for this mischief  
In this world or the next  
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance  
And the hell fires raged in his eyes  
He said you wanna know the truth son?  
Lord, I'll tell you the truth  
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing,  
You try to hide your deepest sins,  
Of all the things that you've done wrong,  
And I know where you belong.  
  
Time is always on my side,  
Time is always on my side.  
  
Make you an offer you can't refuse,  
You've only got your soul to lose  
Eternally  
Just let yourself go!  
  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught now in two minds!

1297,Iron Maiden,Chains Of Misery,"There's a madman in the corner of  
Your eye  
He likes to pry, into your sunlight  
He wants to burst into the street  
With you and I  
A world of shadows and of rain  
He's seen what love is  
He wants to pay you back with guilt  
  
He lies to you he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned your key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
There's a prophet in the gutter  
In the street  
He say ""you're damned!""  
And you believe him  
He's got a vision but it shines out  
Through your eyes  
A world of hatred and fear  
He's felt what love means  
He wants to pay you back with pain  
  
He lies to you, he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
It's only love that holds the key to  
Our hearts  
It's only love  
  
He lies to you he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
He lies to you he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery

1298,Iron Maiden,Charlotte The Harlot,"Giving a swish with your ass in the air, don't you know what they're saying?  
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.  
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?  
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?  
  
[Chorus]  
Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs,  
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed.  
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood,  
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love.  
  
Taking so many men to your room, don't you feel no remorse?  
You charge them a ""fiver"", It's only for starters.  
And ten for the main course.  
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago.  
Don't you care who you let in?  
And don't you know you're breaking the law with the service you're giving.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was a time when you left me standing there,  
Picking up pieces of love off the floor.  
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there,  
To make your ends as a bloody whore.  
Well Charlotte you told me you love me true,  
Picking up pieces of love yesterday.  
Well Charlotte you're draws are off color too  
'Cause you're making love all day.  
  
Giving a swish with your ass in the air, don't you know what they're saying?  
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.  
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?  
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?

1299,Iron Maiden,Childhood's End,"I'd sail across the ocean  
I'd walk a hundred miles  
If I could make it to the end  
Oh just to see a smile  
  
You see it in their faces  
The sadness in their tears  
The desperation and the anger  
Madness and the fear  
  
No hope, no life, just pain and fear  
No food, no love, just greed is here  
  
Starvation and the hunger  
The suffering and the pain  
The agonies of all-out war  
When will it come again?  
  
The struggle for the power  
A tyrant tries again  
Just what the hell is going on?  
When will it ever end?  
  
No hope, no life, just pain and fear  
No food, no love, just greed is here  
  
You see the full moon float  
You watch the red sun rise  
We take these things for granted  
But somewhere someone's dying  
  
Contaminated waters  
Pollution and decay  
Just waiting for disease to strike  
Oh will we learn someday?  
  
No hope, no life, just pain and fear  
No food, no love, no seed  
Childhood's end

"
1300,Iron Maiden,Children Of The Damned,"(Harris)  
  
He's walking like a small child  
But watch his eyes burn you away  
Black holes in his golden stare  
God knows he wants to go home  
Children of The Damned  
(repeat another 3 times)  
  
He's walking like a dead man  
If he had lived he would have crucified us all  
Now he's standing on his last stand  
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all  
Children of The Damned  
(repeat another 3 times)  
  
Now it burns his hand he's turning to laugh  
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh  
Melting his face screaming in pain  
Peeling the skin from his eyes  
Watch him die according to plan  
He's dust on the ground what did we learn  
  
You're Children of The Damned  
Your back's against the wall  
You turn into the light  
You're burning in the night  
You're Children of The Damned  
Like candles watch them burn  
Burning in the light  
You'll burn again tonight  
You're Children of The Damned

1301,Iron Maiden,Churchill Speech,"We shall go on to the end.  
We shall fight in France  
We shall fight over the seas and oceans.  
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.  
We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be  
We shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds,  
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets,  
We shall fight on the hills.  
We shall never surrender.

"
1302,Iron Maiden,Como Estais Amigos,"Como esta amigo  
For the death of those we don't go  
Shall we kneel and say a prayer  
They will never know we care  
Shall we keep the fires burning  
Shall we keep the flames alight  
Should we try to remember  
What is wrong and what is right  
  
No more tears, no more tears  
If we live for a hundred years  
Amigos no more tears  
  
And if we do forget them  
and the sacrifice they made  
Will the wickedness and sadness  
come to visit us again  
Shall we dance the dance in sunlight  
Shall we drink the wine of peace  
Shall our tears be of joy  
Shall we keep at bay the beast  
  
Inside the scream is silent  
Inside it must remain  
No victory and no vanquished  
Only horror, only pain

"
1303,Iron Maiden,Dance Of Death,"Let me tell you a story to chill the bones  
About a thing that I saw  
One night wandering in the everglades  
I'd one drink but no more  
  
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight  
Gazing up at the stars  
Not aware of a presence so near to me  
Watching my every move  
  
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees  
As something rushed me from the trees  
Took me to an unholy place  
And that is where I fell from grace  
  
Then they summoned me over to join in with them  
To the dance of the dead  
Into the circle of fire I followed them  
Into the middle I was led  
  
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear  
But still I wanted to go  
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me  
As I walked onto the coals  
  
And I felt I was in a trance  
And my spirit was lifted from me  
And if only someone had the chance  
To witness what happened to me  
  
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them  
All had death in their eyes  
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them  
They had ascended from hell  
  
As I danced with the dead  
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me  
Below my undead body  
Just danced the circle of dead  
  
Until the time came to reunite us both  
My spirit came back down to me  
I didn't know if I was alive or dead  
As the others all joined in with me  
  
By luck then a skirmish started  
And took the attention away from me  
When they took their gaze from me  
Was the moment that I fled  
  
I ran like hell faster than the wind  
But behind I did not glance  
One thing that I did not dare  
Was to look just straight ahead  
  
When you know that your time has come around  
You know you'll be prepared for it  
Say your last goodbyes to everyone  
Drink and say a prayer for it  
  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
  
To this day I guess I'll never know  
Just why they let me go  
But I'll never go dancing no more  
'Til I dance with the dead

"
1304,Iron Maiden,Deja Vu,"When you see familiar faces,  
But you don't remember where they're from,  
Could you be wrong?  
When you've been particular places,  
That you know you've never been before,  
Can you be sure?  
'Cause you know this has happened before,  
And you know that this moment in time is for real,  
And you know when you feel Deja vu.  
  
Chorus:[Chorus]  
Feel like I've been here before,  
Feel like I've been here before.  
  
Ever had a conversation,  
That you realize you've had before,  
Isn't it strange?  
Have you ever talked to someone,  
And you feel you know what's coming next?  
It feels pre-arranged.  
'Cause you know that you've heard it before,  
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal,  
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu.

"
1305,Iron Maiden,Die With Your Boots On,"Another prophet of disaster  
Who says the ship is lost  
Another prophet of disaster  
Leaving you to count the cost  
Taunting us with visions  
Afflicting us with fear  
Predicting war for millions  
In the hope that one appears  
  
No point asking when it is  
No point asking who's to go  
No point asking what's the game  
No point asking who's to blame  
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,  
if you're gonna die  
  
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on  
If you're gonna try, well stick around  
Gonna cry, just move along  
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die  
  
In thirteen the beast is rising  
The Frenchman did surmise  
Through earthquakes and starvation  
The warlord will arise  
Terror, death, destruction  
Pour from the eastern sands  
But the truth of all predictions  
Is always in your hands  
  
No point asking when it is  
No point asking who's to go  
No point asking what's the game  
No point asking who's to blame  
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,  
if you're gonna die  
  
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on  
If you're gonna try, just stick around  
Gonna cry, just move along  
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

1306,Iron Maiden,Different World,"You lead me on the path  
Keep showing me the way  
I feel a little lost  
A little strange today  
  
I think I'll take a hold  
Of whatever comes my way  
Then we'll see what happens  
Take it day by day  
  
I thought I had it all  
I had it all worked out  
Just what my future held  
That there would be no doubt  
  
But then the card came up  
And I took another turn  
But I don't know if it's  
Fulfillment that I yearn  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
To view the world

When you see the simple things  
To appreciate this life  
It's not too late to learn  
  
Don't want to be here  
Somewhere I'd rather be  
But when I get there  
I might find it's not for me  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
To view the world  
  
I would like you to know

Feel the adrenaline pump

Begin to run now  
The sweat runs down your face  
  
Don't know which way to turn

Could be the last time  
You see the light of day

Don't look trough the eyes of a fool

I got a vision for you  
It's my personal snake oil  
It's just something I do  
  
I'm the jester with no tears  
And I'm playing on your fears  
I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death  
The eternal lie I've told  
About the pyramids of gold  
I've got you hooked at every turn your money's left to burn  
  
You'll be wanting a contract  
You'll be waiting a while  
I'd like to give you my contact  
But that isn't my style  
  
Well you only get one chance  
And it's too good to miss  
if i didn't lie to ya  
Then I wouldn't exist  
  
Greed, lust and anvy pride  
It's the same old, same old ride  
The smoke and mirrors visions that you see are just like me  
I'm a banker's face  
With just a letter out of place  
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way

And gone is the gold  
Well if you knew the story  
How come, it has to be told  
  
Well you can say I'm a devil  
And I wouldn't say no  
But out here on the dark side  
Hey, on with the show  
  
So now my tale is told  
Big and bad and twice as bold  
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow  
There is no easy way  
For an honest man today  
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold

1310,Iron Maiden,Fates Warning,"Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive  
And some of us are here just so that we'll die  
How come the bullet hits the other guy  
Do we have to try and reason why  
  
[Chorus]  
Be it the devil or be it him  
You can count on just one thing  
When the time is up you'll know  
Not just one power runs the show  
  
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day  
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away  
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the lord above  
Or the devil himself come to give you a shove

1311,Iron Maiden,Fear Is The Key,"We live our lives in fever  
In a choking sweat of fear  
In the heat of the night you can  
Feel so much  
In the heat of the night I scream  
""Don't touch!""  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame  
  
We live in fever  
  
I hear your secret heartbeat  
I can hear your silent cries  
The kids have lost their freedom  
And nobody cares till somebody  
Famous dies  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame  
  
Now we live, in a world of uncertainty  
Fear is the key, to what you want to be  
You don't get a say the majority  
Gets its way  
You're outnumbered by the bastards  
Till the day you die

The battle is nearing  
You'd better get ready to fight for your lives

Getting ready to begin again  
  
Wounded, lying, crying  
Bodies moving and dying  
All around there is the smell  
Of death and fire  
  
Here the planes are coming  
Hear the soldiers running  
Killing on a scale to comprehend  
  
Why are we here  
In this place... Here to kill  
Please God forgive us for  
What we have done  
  
I always thought I was doing right  
As of now I'm not feeling so sure  
  
I'm at a place of where  
I give no grace  
I'm a soldier of war  
  
I sit waiting for my darkest hour  
To come  
I cannot think about the things  
That I have done  
It shouldn't take a fool to see  
That I believe  
Accept the consequence  
Repent for what I've done  
  
You tell me what is certain  
But I'll tell you what is true  
You tell me that is honesty  
When all around is death and cruelty  
  
The making of a man is fire  
By giving in to our desires  
Within the truth that lies  
Within the only thing

Some say you are a lost cause  
Some say you're a Saint  
Just being here's an act of  
Sufering and restraint  
  
Walk down the long dark road  
To ruin panic not  
I'll die a lonely death of that  
I'm certain of  
  
Rivers flow with blood  
There's nowhere left to hide  
It's hard to comprehend  
There's anyone left alive  
  
Sick of all the killing  
And the reek of death  
Will God tell me  
What religion is to man  
  
I don't hold with bad religion  
Understand what's underneath it  
Now I come to think of it  
I just don't hold at all you know it  
  
You say you are a holy man  
But what is it you do  
From where I stand is nothing  
But a hollow man I see  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of death desire  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath of fire  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of pain  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath  
  
I'm just a lonely soldier fighting  
In a bloody hopeless war  
Don't know what I'm fighting  
Who it is or what I'm fighting for  
  
Though it was for money  
Make my fortune now I'm not  
So sure  
Seem to just have lost my way

1314,Iron Maiden,Murders In The Rue Morgue,"I remember it as plain as day  
Although it happened in the dark of the night.  
I was strolling through the streets of Paris  
And it was cold it was starting to rain.  
And then I heard a piercing scream  
And I rushed to the scene of the crime  
But all I found was the butchered remains  
Of two girls lay side by side.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Run before the killers go free  
  
There's some people coming down the street  
At last there's someone heard my call  
I can't understand why they're pointing at me  
I never done nothing at all.  
But I must have got some blood on my hands  
Because everyone's shouting at me  
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain  
And like a fool I started running away.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free.  
  
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.  
All France is looking for me.  
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure  
Down the south to Italy.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.  
  
Well I made it to the border at last  
But I can't erase the scene from my mind  
Anytime somebody stares at me, well  
I just start running blind  
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night  
Away from the staring eyes  
Any day they'll be looking for me  
'Cause I know I show the signs of...  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the arms of the law  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
It took so long and I'm getting so tired  
I'm running out of places to hide  
Should I return to the scene of the crime  
Where the two young victims died  
If I could go to somebody for help  
It'd get me out of trouble for sure  
But I know that it's on my mind  
That my doctor said I've done it before.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
They're never gonna find me

1316,Iron Maiden,No More Lies,"There's a darkened sky before me  
There's no time to prepare  
Salvage a last horizon  
But no regrets from me  
  
Maybe I'll be back some other day  
To live again just who can say  
In what shape or form that I might be  
Just another chance for me  
  
A hurried time no disgrace  
Instead of racing to conclusion  
And wishing all my life away  
No-one can stop me now  
  
Time is up it couldn't last  
But there's more things I'd like to do  
I'm coming back to try again  
Someday maybe I'll wait till then  
  
No more lies  
  
They're all sitting at my table  
Talking tall and drinking wine  
Their time is up just like me  
But they just don't know it yet  
  
So just a word of warning  
When you're in your deepest dreams  
There's nothing you can hide from  
I've got my eye on you  
  
The clock is fast, the hour is near  
Eventful past is ever clear  
My life is set, the time is here  
I think I'm coming home  
  
No more lies  
  
A hurried time, no disgrace  
Instead of racing to conclusions  
And wishing all your life away  
No-one can stop me now  
  
Time is up it couldn't last  
But there's more things I have to do  
I'm coming back to try again  
Don't tell me that this is the end  
  
No more lies

1317,Iron Maiden,Out Of The Shadows,"Hold a halo round the world  
Golden is the day  
Princes of the Universe,  
Your burden is the way  
So there is no better time,  
Who will be born today  
A gypsy child at the day break  
A King for a day  
  
[Chorus:]  
Out of the Shadow and into the sun  
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done  
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain  
But we must endure it to live again  
  
Dusty dreams in fading daylight  
Flicker on the walls  
Nothing new your life's adrift  
What purpose to it all?  
Eyes are closed and death is calling  
Reaching out its hand  
Call upon the starlight to surround you  
  
Out of the Shadow and into the sun  
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done  
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain  
But we must endure it to live again

A man who casts no shadow has no soul

1318,Iron Maiden,Out Of The Silent Planet,"Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
  
Weathered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation  
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation  
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above  
You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live  
The punishment is death for all who live  
  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
  
The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium.  
Separate lives, no more disguise, no more second chances.  
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate.  
I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late.  
Before you know the crime it's all too late.  
  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, come the demons of creation.  
  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent  
Planet we are.  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.  
  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are,  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.

1319,Iron Maiden,Pass The Jam,"I don't care  
They're crazy  
Said pass the jam, would you  
Awfully kind of you  
Now wouldn't it be a little bit nice to sing with this  
  
Gazing at the open door  
Just what lays behind  
Thinking what I'm looking for  
Say what's on my mind  
  
Sinking ever deeper  
In the words of guilt of shame  
And now I can redeem myself  
I just don't care  
  
The words I'm singing they're just right  
That's better for my brain  
If I try to make much sense  
You know I'll go insane  
  
I just don't care  
I just don't care  
  
Stay and have some jam with tea  
But Brutus wasn't kind  
Wasn't strawberries that were red  
He wasn't cutting bread  
  
You pass the jam  
And so he slammed the tea  
? here to me  
Was in the conservatory  
  
Yeah, alright  
Yes, but still over there  
Sinking ever deeper  
In the words of guilt and shame  
I can redeem myself  
I just don't care  
  
Staring at the silver spoon  
Take it from your mouth  
Take it from the chapter  
Turn and face the south  
  
Now face the north  
And the east  
And the west  
And the ?serpent song?  
  
Still burning on in the night  
Where's the sun at midnight  
Say it's gone  
  
Where's the moon at dawn  
It carries on and on  
It never ends  
  
To the land of nevermore  
Where time began  
Where the man still stands  
  
And the ? 'x' ? at the end  
Never know that I sang  
You'll all know it's the right place  
In time, well it is  
  
The words I'm singing  
That's just right  
They're better for my brain  
If I try to make much sense  
You know I'll go insane

1320,Iron Maiden,Phantom Of The Opera,"I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp.  
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask.  
And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last.  
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past.  
  
You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.  
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.  
Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.  
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call.  
  
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.  
Don't you stray, don't fade away.  
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.  
Don't you stray, from the narrow way.  
  
I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.  
You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.  
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.  
Haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair.

1321,Iron Maiden,Powerslave,"Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus  
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go  
Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple  
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me why I had to be a power slave  
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?  
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.  
And in my last hour,  
I'm a slave to the power of death.  
  
When I was living this lie-fear was my game  
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees  
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me  
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,  
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone  
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages  
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.

1322,Iron Maiden,Prodigal Son,"Listen to me Lamia, listen to what I've got to say.  
I've got these feelings, and they won't go away.  
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees.  
Oh help me Lamia or I'm sure I'll die, oh please.  
  
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong.  
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for too long.  
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me,  
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be.  
  
I'm on my knees, oh help me please.  
I'm on my knees, help me please.  
  
Oh Lamia please try to help me.  
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.  
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.  
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh

1325,Iron Maiden,Public Enema Number One,"When it all comes down the line  
And the lights they turn to greed  
And you race off with your tyres screaming  
Rolling thunder  
And the people choke with poison  
Children cry in fear  
But you've got your fast bullet  
One way ticket outta here

Fall on your knees today  
And pray the world will mend its ways  
Get to your feet again  
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain  
  
In the cities in the streets

Breaking strain is fast approaching  
Guns and riots  
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins  
And the press get fed the scapegoats  
Public enema number one

A million network slaves  
In an advertising new age  
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya  
Your children have more brains  
Than your drug infested remains  
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming

Fantasies lived times before.  
I split my brain, melt through the floor.  
  
Over clouds my mind will fly, forever now I can't think why.  
My body tries to leave my soul.  
Or is it me, I just don't know.  
Memories rising from the past, the future's shadow overcast.  
Something's clutching at my head, through the darkness I'll be led.  
  
Oh another time, another place.  
Oh another smile on another face.  
When you see me floating up beside you,  
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.  
  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

1327,Iron Maiden,Quest For Fire,"In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth  
When the land was swamp and caves were home  
In an age when prize possession was fire  
To search for landscapes men would roam.  
  
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire  
And the wolves they howled into the night  
As they fought a vicious angry battle  
To save the power of warmth and light.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched all through the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.  
  
And they thought that when the embers died away  
That the flame of life had burnt and died  
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire  
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.  
  
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger  
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts  
In the search to find another fire  
To regain the power of light and heat.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched across the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.

Packed your bags in a hurry  
Because your mind's in a worry  
Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away  
  
Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile  
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes  
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe  
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Yes I'm so tired  
So tired

And your bird, she's singing  
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away

1329,Iron Maiden,Rainmaker,"When I was wandering in the desert  
And was searching for the truth  
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name  
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again  
I turned my face towards the barren sun  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground  
They are sealed and are now washed away  
  
[Chorus:]  
You tell me we can start the rain  
You tell me that we all can change  
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away  
You tell me we can start the rain  
You tell me that we all can change  
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives  
They are sealed and now far away

You're fighting your friends  
You're wearing everybody out  
But it never ends

Come on  
Reach out  
And let somebody in your life

You need to be loved  
It's not such a crime

Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.  
  
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.

1332,Iron Maiden,Revelations,"""O God of Earth and Altar,  
Bow down and hear our cry,  
Our earthly rulers falter,  
Our people drift and die,  
The walls of gold entomb us,  
The swords of scorn divide,  
Take not thy thunder from us,  
But take away our pride.""  
(G. K. Chesterton English Hymnal)  
  
Just a babe in the black abyss,  
No reason for a place like this,  
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,  
An easy way for the blind to go,  
A clever path for the fools who know  
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
She came to me with a serpent's kiss,  
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,  
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,  
So we lay in the black embrace,  
And the Seed is sown in a holy place  
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.  
  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
Bind all of us together,  
Ablaze with Hope and Free,  
No storm or heavy weather  
Will rock the boat you'll see.  
The time has come to close your eyes  
And still the wind and rain,  
For the one who will be King  
Is the Watcher in the Ring,  
It is You  
It is You

"
1333,Iron Maiden,Rime Of The Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner  
See his eye as he stops one of three  
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests  
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.  
  
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by  
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.  
  
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice  
To a place where nobody's been  
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross  
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.  
  
And the ship sails on, back to the North  
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.  
  
The mariner kills the bird of good omen  
His shipmates cry against what he's done  
But when the fog clears, they justify him  
And make themselves a part of the crime.  
  
Sailing on and on and north across the sea  
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.  
  
The albatross begins with it's vengeance  
A terrible curse a thirst has begun  
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner  
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.  
  
And the curse goes on and on at sea  
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.  
  
""Day after day, day after day,  
We stuck nor breath nor motion  
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  
Water, water everywhere and  
All the boards did shrink  
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink.""  
  
There calls the mariner  
There comes a ship over the line  
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?  
  
She... onward she comes  
Onward she nears out of the sun  
See, she has no crew  
She has no life, wait but here's two.  
  
Death and she life in death,  
They throw their dice for the crew  
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.  
Then, crew one by one  
They drop down dead, two hundred men  
She, she, Life in Death.  
She lets him live, her chosen one.  
  
""One after one by the star dogged moon,  
Too quick for groan or sigh  
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang  
And cursed me with his eye  
Four times fifty living men  
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)  
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,  
They dropped down one by one.""  
  
The curse it lives on in their eyes  
The mariner he wished he'd die  
Along with the sea creatures  
But they lived on, so did he.  
  
And by the light of the moon  
He prays for their beauty not doom  
With heart he blesses them  
God's creatures all of them too.  
  
Then the spell starts to break  
The albatross falls from his neck  
Sinks down like lead into the sea  
Then down in falls comes the rain.  
  
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen  
See them stir and they start to rise  
Bodies lifted by good spirits  
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes  
  
And revenge is still sought, penance starts again  
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.  
  
Now the curse is finally lifted  
And the mariner sights his home  
Spirits go from the long dead bodies  
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.  
  
And then a boat came sailing towards him  
It was a joy he could not believe  
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,  
Penance of life will fall onto him.  
  
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea  
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.  
  
The mariner's bound to tell of his story  
To tell this tale wherever he goes  
To teach God's word by his own example  
That we must love all things that God made.  
  
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man  
And the tale goes on and on and on.

"
1334,Iron Maiden,Road To Hell,"Slowly bleeding, watch the vortex feeding  
Like a swirling vulture on your face  
Every hour the unseen rays devour  
Your screaming eyes cry out but they are blind  
  
Father, forgive me my sins  
Give me the nails, I'll hammer them in  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell, we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Get on the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
Brave new world of secret fantasy  
That hovers just beyond your bloody grasp  
Close enough to thrill, the danger of the kill  
Price for failure of your will  
  
Father, forgive us our sins  
'Cause we're all the junkies who never can win  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell, we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
Father, forgive me my sins  
Give me the nails, I'll hammer them in  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Parody of hope is the one that I must kill  
We all have to live with our family inventions  
Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell, we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets

1335,Iron Maiden,"Run Silent, Run Deep","The convoy lights are dead ahead  
The merchantmen lay in their bed  
The thump of diesels hammers down  
In the oily sea-the killing ground  
His knuckles white his eyes alight  
He slams the hatch on the deadly night  
A cunning fox in the chickens lair  
A hound of hell and the devil don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer  
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare  
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below  
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep  
  
Chill the hearts of fighting men  
In open ocean wondering when?  
The lethal silver fish will fly  
The boat will shiver-men will die  
A cast of millions-a part to play  
Killer victim or fool for a day  
Obeying an order-men have to die  
Us or them-a well rehearsed lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn  
The tar black smell of burning oil  
On the way down to Davy Jones  
Every man for himself-you're on your own  
The wolf eyes watch the cross wire  
'stern tubes ready', 'aim and fire

1338,Iron Maiden,Sanctuary,"Out of the winter came a war horse of steel  
I've never killed a woman before, but I know how it feels  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive  
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive  
I know you'd gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight  
  
I can laugh at the wind, I can howl at the rain.  
Down in the canyon or out in the plain.  
  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright

1339,Iron Maiden,Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son,"Here they stand brothers them all  
All the sons divided they'd fall  
Here await the birth of the son  
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one  
  
Here the birth from an unbroken line  
Born the healer the seventh, his time  
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds  
Slowly unveiling the power he holds  
  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
  
Then they watch the progress he makes  
The Good and the Evil which path will he take  
Both of them trying to manipulate  
The use of his powers before it's too late  
  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
  
Today is born the seventh one  
Born of woman the seventh son  
And he in turn of a seventh son  
He has the power to heal  
He has the gift of the second sight  
He is the chosen one  
So it shall be written  
So it shall be done

1340,Iron Maiden,Sheriff Of Huddersfield,"(Iron Maiden)  
  
Life in a city living in L. A.  
Is a long way from Huddersfield town  
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven  
But that's where he get's his pork pie  
Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy  
Rugby and cricket's unknown  
Baseball and football they're making him lazy  
Your fan club says ""Rodney come home""  
  
[Chorus:]  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
Look down on Hollywood Hills  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels  
  
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels  
The Nautilus rusts in the yard  
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning  
He'll always live in L. A.  
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket  
And never comes out to pay bills  
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker  
And he always cheats when he deals  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
(Rodney's rap)  
Hello, let me introduce meself!  
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong.  
When I were a lad, I could lift up five  
Navies on an end of a shovel.  
The reason I never took martial arts because  
I was immensely fearsome and  
I'd probably kill everybody  
I came into contact with it.  
I was phenomenally strong.  
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,  
Is what makes the world rotate.  
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield  
But I don't live there anymore.  
I live in Los Angeles.  
It's great!... I think  
  
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed  
To wrench himself up in the morn'  
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed  
You'll wish you'd never been born.  
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead  
He slumbers for most of the day  
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast  
Your problem Rodney L. A.

1341,Iron Maiden,Speed Of Light,"Another time another place  
A hollow universe in space  
I took a trip to see the sights  
That will be blacker than the night  
  
One way ticket no returns  
My shooting stars are vastly burnt  
On the edge that you can see  
  
Let's shoot the moon you and me  
I'm not particular you'll see  
Just a lonesome galaxy  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
We slip into the night  
  
I'll say a mass for you and wave  
Shooting plasma from my grave  
  
Event horizon lost in space  
Running in a human race  
  
I don't know where I don't know why  
But somehow back in time again  
I'm on the edge that you can see  
  
I'm not particular at night  
A single party calling me  
You won't be tracking me by sight  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars

1342,Iron Maiden,Still Life,"Take a look in the pool and what do you see  
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me  
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see  
They were there oh I know you don't believe me  
  
Oh, I've never felt so strange  
But, I'm not going insane  
  
I've no doubt that you think I'm off my head  
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead  
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool  
Something draws me there I don't know what to do  
  
Oh, they drain my strength away  
Oh, they're asking me to stay  
  
Nightmares, spirits calling me  
Nightmares, they won't leave me be  
  
All my life's blood is slowly draining away  
And I feel that I'm weaker every day  
Somehow I know I haven't long to go  
Joining them at the bottom of the pool  
  
Now, I feel they are so near  
I, begin to see them clear  
  
Nightmares, coming all the time  
Nightmares, Will give me peace of mind  
  
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do  
I must take you down there to look at them too  
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool  
Can't you see not just me they want you too  
  
Oh, we'll drown together  
It, will be forever  
  
Nightmares, forever calling me  
Nightmares, Now we rest in peace

1343,Iron Maiden,Strange World,"The only place where you can dream, living here is not what it seems.  
Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why.  
Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare.  
A let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place.  
  
Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.  
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.  
Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.  
A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old.  
  
Don't you hear me call? Oh

"
1344,Iron Maiden,Stranger In A Strange Land,"Was many years ago that I left home and came this way,  
I was a young man full of hopes and dreams,  
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained,  
Sometimes things ain't what they seem,  
No brave new world, no brave new world,  
No brave new world, no brave new world.  
  
Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky,  
My spirit wanders endlessly,  
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why,  
Hear me calling, rescue me,  
Set me free, set me free,  
Lost in this place and leave no trace.  
  
Stranger in a strange land,  
Land of ice and snow,  
Trapped here in this prison, yeah!  
Lost and far from home.  
  
One hundred years have gone and men again they came that way,  
To find the answer to the mystery,  
They found his body lying where it fell on that day,  
Preserved in time for all to see,  
No brave new world, no brave new world,  
Lost in this place, and leave no trace.  
  
What became of the man that started  
All are gone and their souls departed  
Left me here in this place  
So all alone  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
What became of the man that started  
All are gone and their souls departed  
Left me here in this place  
So all alone  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home

1345,Iron Maiden,Sun And Steel,"You killed your first man at 13,  
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,  
By 16 you had learned to fight  
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.  
  
Sunlight, falling on your steel,  
Death in life is your ideal,  
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on.  
  
Through earth and water, fire and wind,  
you came at last-nothing was the end,  
Make a cut by fire and stones,  
Take you and your blade and break you both  
in two-break you both in two.  
  
Sunlight, falling on your steel,  
Death in life is your ideal,  
Life is like a wheel-and it's rolling still.

1346,Iron Maiden,That Girl,"The words she said turned out why  
Desperation fills her eyes  
Hold her in your arms

When you taste defeat, when you loose again  
Fight and win, never give in  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
That girl you need  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
That girl, you know  
She'll never let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
That girl, That girl, That girl you need  
That girl, That girl, That girl, That girl  
  
Can you hear her call, call out your name  
Think about you, cry without you  
Hold her in your arm  
Don't let go  
  
Can you taste defeat, when you loose again  
Fight and win, never give in  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
That girl you need  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
That girl, you know  
She'll never let you go

1347,Iron Maiden,The Aftermath,"Silently to silence fall  
In the fields of futile war  
Toys of death are spitting lead  
Where boys that were our soldiers bled  
war horse and war machine  
  
Curse the name of liberty  
Marching on as if they should  
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood  
  
In the mud and rain  
What are we fighting for  
Is it worth the pain is it worth dying for  
Who will take the blame  
Why did they make a war  
Questions that come again  
Should we be fighting at all  
  
Once a ploughman hitched his team  
Here he sowed his little dream  
Now bodies arms and legs are strewn  
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom  
Each moment's like a year  
I've nothing left inside for tears  
Comrades dead or dying lie  
I'm left alone asking why  
  
After the war  
Left feeling no one has won  
After the war  
What does a soldier become

1348,Iron Maiden,The Apparition,"Now I'm here can you see me  
'cause I'm out on my own  
When the room goes cold tell me  
You can feel me  
Cause I'm here  
  
Here I am, can you see me  
Passing through, on my way  
To a place I'd been to only in my  
Dreams before  
  
In a world of delusion  
Never turn your back on a friend  
'cause you can count your  
Real true friends on one hand  
  
Through life  
  
There are those that deceive you  
There are those that'll let you down  
Is there someone out there that would  
Die for you  
Thought not  
  
Live your life with a passion  
Everything you do, do well  
You only get out of life what you put in  
So they say  
  
In a world of confusion  
People never say what they mean  
If you want a straight answer  
Go look for one  
Right now  
  
In a room full of strangers  
Do you stand with your back to the wall  
Do you sometimes feel like you're  
On the outside  
Looking in?  
  
You can make your own luck  
You create your destiny  
I believe you have the power  
If you want to  
It's true  
  
You can do what you want to  
If you try a little bit harder  
A little bit of faith goes a long way  
It does  
  
Are we here for a reason?  
I'd like to know just what you think  
It would be nice to know what  
Happens when we die  
Wouldn't it?  
There are some who are wise  
There are some who are born naive  
I believe that there are some that must  
Have lived before  
Don't you?  
  
As for me, well I'm thinking  
You gotta keep an open mind  
But I hope that my life's not an  
Open and shut case  
  
Extrasensory Perception  
Life after death, telepathy  
Can the soul live on and travel through  
Space and time?  
  
You know I feel so elated  
'cause I'm about to find it out  
And when I know all the answers  
Maybe then I'll come back  
To fill you in  
  
You don't be alarmed now  
If I try to contact you  
If things go missing or get moved around  
It's me  
And don't disbelieve it  
No matter what your ""friends""  
Might say  
We'll meet up again someplace  
Some way  
One day

1349,Iron Maiden,The Assassin,"Now the contracts out  
They've put the word about  
I'm coming after you  
  
It's not the money I make  
It's the thrill of the chase  
And I'm coming after you  
  
I watch your every move  
Study the things you do  
And the pattern of your ways  
  
I watch the way you walk  
I hear your telephone talk  
I want to understand the way you think

Better watch out, cause I'm the assassin,  
Better watch out, better watch out

I taste the smell of death  
I know the moment's getting closer  
  
And as you walk to the light  
I feel my hands go tight  
Excitement running through my veins  
  
I've got you in my sights  
I've got you dead to rights  
The triggers waiting for my finger  
  
I feel adrenalin rush  
It's just the final touch  
You can kiss your ass goodbye

1350,Iron Maiden,The Clairvoyant,"Feel the sweat break on my brow  
Is it me or is it shadows that are  
Dancing on the walls  
Is this a dream or is it now  
Is this a vision or normality I see  
Before my eyes  
  
I wonder why I wonder how  
That it seems that the powers getting stronger  
Every day  
I feel a strength an inner fire  
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
  
Just by looking through your eyes  
He could see the future penetrating right  
In through your mind  
See the truth and see your lies  
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
And reborn again?

And be free and a race  
That is part of a clan

And the air that you breathe  
So pure and so clean  
  
When alone on the hills  
With the wind in your hair  
With a longing to feel  
Just to be free

Just want to be free  
With a need to belong

It's a land wrought with change

What is happening now  
They would turn in their graves  
They would all be ashamed  
That the land of the free  
Has been written in chains  
And I know what I want  
  
When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what is mine

1352,Iron Maiden,The Duelists,"He threw down a glove you made the mistake  
Of picking it up now you're gone  
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords  
The choice of weapons is done

You know you don't have a chance.

A lunge and a feint, a parry too late  
A cut to the chest and you're down  
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain  
Feeling the sweat on your brow.  
CHORUS  
The fighting resumes, a silence looms the swordsmen move 'gainst each

Meanwhile the Reaper looks on.

1353,Iron Maiden,The Edge Of Darkness,"I've looked into the heart of darkness  
Where the blood red journey ends  
When you've faced the heart of darkness  
Even your soul begins to bend  
  
For a week I have been waiting  
Still I am only in Saigon  
The walls move in a little closer  
I feel the jungle call me on  
  
Every minute I get weaker  
While in the jungle they grow strong  
What I wanted was a mission  
And for my sins they gave me one  
  
They brought it up just like room service  
Cause everyone gets what they want  
And when that mission was all over  
I'd never want another one  
  
I know, captain that you've done this work before  
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure  
The colonel's gone rogue  
and his methods are unsound  
You'll take a PBR up river track him down  
  
There's a conflict in every human heart  
And the temptation is to take it all too far  
In this war things get so confused  
But there are some things which can not be excused  
  
He's acting like a god an insane lunatic  
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice  
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow  
Here is the file and it's all you need to know  
  
Here I am the knife in my hand  
And now I understand why the genius must die  
  
Now I stand alone in darkness  
With his blood upon my hands  
Where sat the warrior the poet  
Now lie the fragments of a man

1354,Iron Maiden,The Evil That Men Do,"Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade  
Slept in the dust with his daughter,  
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence  
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud  
And I will bleed for her, if I could only see her now  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Balancing on a ledge, living on a razor's edge  
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
  
Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems  
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me  
And I will pray for you, someday I may return  
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn  
  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on

The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do  
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do

"
1355,Iron Maiden,The Longest Day,"In the gloom the gathering storm abates  
In the ships gimlet eyes await  
The call to arms to hammer at the gates  
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate  
  
All summers long the drills to build the machine  
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel  
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach  
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach  
  
Overlord, your master not your god  
The enemy coast dawning Grey with scud  
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear  
To take a bullet for those who sent them here  
  
The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame  
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains  
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate  
A choking death enter hell's gate  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive  
  
[Chorus x2:]  
How long on this longest day  
'Til we finally make it through  
How long on this longest day  
'Til we finally make it through  
  
The rising dead, faces bloated torn  
They are relieved, the living wait their turn  
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name  
You still go on, to hell and back again  
  
Valhalla waits, valkyries rise and fall  
The warrior tombs, lie open for us all  
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil  
Blood and sand, we will prevail  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive  
  
[Chorus x 4]

1356,Iron Maiden,The Mercenary,"Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you  
Diablo come again to make trophies out of men  
Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full  
In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
  
Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined  
Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright  
Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied  
Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay live  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain

"
1357,Iron Maiden,The Trooper,"You'll take my life but I'll take yours too  
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through  
So when you're waiting for the next attack  
You'd better stand there's no turning back  
  
The bugle sounds as the charge begins  
But on this battlefield no one wins  
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath  
As you plunge into a certain death  
  
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run  
The mighty roar of the Russian guns  
And as we race towards human wall  
The screams of pain as my comrades fall  
  
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground  
And as the Russians fire another round  
We get so near yet so far away  
We won't live to fight another day  
  
We get so close near enough to fight  
When a Russian gets me in his sights  
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow  
A burst of rounds takes my horse below  
  
And as I lay there gazing at the sky  
My body's numb and my throat is dry  
And as I lay forgotten and alone  
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

"
1358,Iron Maiden,To Tame A Land,"He is the king of all the land  
In the Kingdom of the sands  
Of a time tomorrow.  
  
He rules the sand worms and the Fremen  
In a land amongst the stars  
Of an age tomorrow.  
  
He is destined to be a King  
He rules over everything  
On the land called planet Dune.  
  
Body water is your life  
And without it you would die  
On the desert the planet Dune.  
  
Without a still suit you would fry  
On the sands so hot and dry  
In a world called Arrakis.  
  
It is a land that's rich in spice  
The sand riders and the ""mice""  
That they call the ""Muad'Dib"".  
  
He is the Kwizatz Haderach.  
He is born of Caladan  
And will take the Gom Jabbar.  
  
He has the power to foresee  
Or to look into the past  
He is the ruler of the stars  
  
The time will come for him  
To lay claim his crown,  
And then the foe yes  
They'll be cut down,  
You'll see he'll be the  
Best that there's been,  
Messiah supreme  
True leader of men,  
And when the time  
For judgement's at hand  
Don't fret he's strong  
And he'll make a stand,  
Against evil and fire  
That spreads through the land,  
He has the power  
To make it all end.

"
1359,Iron Maiden,Total Eclipse,"Cold as steel the darkness waits, it's hour will come  
A cry of fear for the chosen worshipping the sun  
Mother natures black revenge on those who waste her life  
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice  
  
[Chorus]  
Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires  
Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires  
Sunrise is gone, Sunrise is gone  
  
Around the world the people stop with terror-stricken eyes  
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly  
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas there's nowhere left to run  
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Around the world the nations wait  
For some wise words from their leading light  
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools  
""Is this the end"" the millions cried  
Clutching their riches as they died  
Those who survive must weather the storm  
  
Gone are the days when man looked down  
They've taken away his sacred crown  
To be so free, it took so long  
It's not the journeys end, it's just begun

"
1360,Iron Maiden,Twilight Zone,"She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call.  
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all,  
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form.  
It's been three long years since I've been gone.  
  
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry.  
I'll never know the reason why I had to go.  
Oh, oh, I'm crying,  
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.  
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?  
Ah can't you see me?  
  
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.  
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's  
Like to be hanging on the other side.  
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.  
  
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,  
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone.  
Oh, oh, I'm crying,  
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.  
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?  
Ah can't you see me?

"
1361,Iron Maiden,Virus,"There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind  
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind  
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite  
A menace to society, a social disease  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay  
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray  
Eating away at your own self esteem  
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order  
  
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand  
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay  
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray  
  
When every good thing's laid to waste  
By all the jealousy and hate  
By all the acid wit and rapier lies  
  
And every time you think you're safe  
And when you go to turn away  
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to relate it  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to escape it  
  
Without a conscience they destroy  
And that's a thing that they enjoy  
They're a sickness that's in all our minds  
  
They want to sink the ship and leave  
The way they laugh at you and me  
You know it happens all the time  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to relate it  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to escape it  
  
The rats in the cellar you know who you are  
Or do you?  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay

"
1362,Iron Maiden,Wasted Years,"From the coast of gold, across the seven seas,  
I'm traveling on, far and wide,  
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself,  
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else.  
  
I close my eyes, and think of home,  
Another city goes by, in the night,  
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it til it's gone away,  
And my heart is lying there and will be til my dying day.  
  
So understand  
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,  
Face up, make your stand,  
And realize you're living in the golden years.  
  
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind,  
Can't ease this pain, so easily,  
When you can't find the words to say, it's hard to make it through another
day,  
And it makes me want to cry, and throw my hands up to the sky.  
  
So understand  
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,  
Face up, make your stand,  
And realize you're living in the golden years.

1363,Iron Maiden,Weekend Warrior,"The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool  
Who are you kidding being that cool?  
  
Trying to break away from running  
With the pack  
But they ain't listening so you've  
Gotta go back  
  
You're a weekend warrior when  
You're one of the crowd  
But it's over, just look at you now  
  
You're not so brave the way you behave  
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick  
It's all bravado when you're out  
With your mates  
It's like a different person goes through  
Those gates  
And the game begins  
The adrenalin's high  
Feel the tension maybe someone  
Will die  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't  
That way anymore  
  
You've gotta get out gotta get away  
But you're in with a clique it's not  
Easy to stray  
You've gotta admit you're just  
Living a lie  
It didn't take long to work out why  
  
It's hard to say why you got involved  
Just wanting to be part  
Just wanting to belong  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't  
That way anymore  
  
Some of the things that you've done  
You feel so ashamed  
After all it's only a game... isn't it?  
And after all the adrenalin's gone  
What you gonna do on Monday?  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you were  
Never like that at all

1364,Iron Maiden,When Two Worlds Collide,"My telescope looks out  
Into the stars tonight  
A little speck of light  
Seems twice the size tonight  
The Calculations are so fine  
Can it be growing all the Time?  
  
Now I can't believe its true  
And I don't know what to do  
For the hundredth time  
I check the declination  
  
Now the fear starts to grow  
Even my computer shows  
There are no errors in the calculations  
  
Now it's happened take no other view  
Collision course, you must believe it's true  
Now there's nothing left that we can do  
  
When Two Worlds collide  
The anger and the pain  
Of all those who remain  
Two worlds collide  
Who will be left alive  
No place to hide  
  
When Two Worlds Collide  
The anger, the pain  
Of those who remain  
When two worlds collide  
When two worlds collide  
So who will survive  
There's No place to hide  
When Two Worlds collide

"
1365,Iron Maiden,Where Eagles Dare,"It's snowing outside the rumbling sound  
Of engines roar in the night.  
The mission is near the confident men  
Are waiting to drop from the sky.  
  
The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly  
No one should go where eagles dare.  
  
Bavarian alps that lay all around  
They seem to stare from below.  
The enemy lines a long time passed  
Are lying deep in the snow.  
  
Into the night they fall through the sky  
No one should fly where eagles dare.  
  
They're closing in the fortress is near  
It's standing high in the sky.  
The cable car's the only way in  
It's really impossible to climb.  
  
They make their way but maybe too late  
They've got to try to save the day.  
  
The panicking cries the roaring of guns  
Are echoing all around the valley.  
The mission complete they make to escape  
Away from the Eagles Nest.  
  
They dared to go where no one would try  
They chose to fly where eagles dare.

1366,Iron Maiden,Wildest Dreams,"I'm gonna organise some changes in my life,  
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past,  
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road,  
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go  
  
And I just feel like I can be anything,  
that I might ever wish to be,  
and fantasize just what I want to to be,  
make my wildest dreams come true  
  
I'm on my way.  
Out on my own again I'm on my way out on the road again,  
  
When I remember back to how that things used to be,  
and I was stuck inside a shroud of misery I felt I disappeared so deep inside
my self  
I couldn't find a way to break away the hell  
  
When I'm feeling down and low,  
I vow I'll never be the same again,  
I just remember what I am, and visualize what I'm gonna be,  
  
I'm on my way. Out on my own again,  
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,  
  
I'm gonna break away, I'm out on my own,  
I'm out on my own, gonna break away, breaking away,  
  
I'm on my way, out my own again,  
I'm on my way, out on the road again, I'm on my way, out on my own again,  
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,

1367,Joy Division,Candidate,"Forced by the pressure,  
The territories marked,  
No longer the pleasure,  
Oh, I've since lost the heart.  
  
Corrupted from memory,  
No longer the power,  
It's creeping up slowly,  
The last fatal hour.  
  
Oh, I don't what made me,  
What gave me the right,  
To mess with your values,  
And change wrong to right.  
  
Please keep your distance,  
The trail leads to here,  
There's blood on your fingers,  
Brought on by fear.

I worked hard for this,  
I tried to get to you,  
You treat me like this.  
  
It's just second nature,  
It's what we've been shown,  
We're living by your rules,  
That's all that we know.

I tried to get to you,  
I tried to get to you.  
I tried to get to you.

1368,Joy Division,Colony,"A cry for help, a hint of anesthesia,  
The sound from broken homes,  
We used to always meet here.  
As he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms,  
Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harm.  
  
A worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye,  
Hands him the bag she packed, the tears she tries to hide,  
A cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy  
And leaves him standing cold here in this colony.  
  
I can't see why all these confrontations,  
I can't see why all these dislocations,  
No family life, this makes me feel uneasy,  
Stood alone here in this colony.  
In this colony, in this colony, in this colony, in this colony.  
  
Dear God in his wisdom took you by the hand,  
God in his wisdom made you understand.  
God in his wisdom took you by the hand,

1369,Joy Division,Day Of The Lords,"This is the room, the start of it all,  
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall,

And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.  
  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
  
These are your friends from childhood, through youth,  
Who goaded you on, demanded more proof,  
Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in,  
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin.  
  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
  
This is the car at the edge of the road,  
There's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed,  
I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat,  
There's no room for the weak, no room for the weak,  
  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
Where will it end? Where will it end?  
  
This is the room, the start of it all,

1370,Joy Division,Decades,"Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders,  
Here are the young men, well where have they been?  
We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,  
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,  
  
Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,  
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.  
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,  
The sorrows we suffered and never were free.  
  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
  
Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,  
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,  
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,  
Open then shut, then slammed in our face.  
  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?  
Where have they been?

Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?  
These sensations barely interest me for another day,  
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away.  
  
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand,  
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it's a no man's land,  
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,  
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow.  
  
What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again,  
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from you friends,  
Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now,

Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,

1373,Joy Division,Exercise One,"When you're looking at life,  
In a strange new room,  
Maybe drowning soon,  
Is this the start of it all?  
Turn on your TV,  
Turn down your pulse,  
Turn away from it all,  
It's all getting too much.  
  
When you're looking at life,  
Deciphering scars,  
Just who fooled who,  
Sit still in their cars,  
The lights look bright,  
When you reach outside,  
Time for one last ride,  
Before the end of it all.

1374,Joy Division,Failures,"Don't speak of safe Messiahs,  
A failure of the modern man,  
To the center of all life's desires,  
As a whole not an also ran.  
Love in a hollow field,  
Break the image of your father's son,  
Drawn to an inner feel,  
He was thought of as the only one,  
He was thought of as the only one.  
  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man.  
Wise words and sympathy,  
Tell the story of our history.  
New strength gives a real touch,  
Sense and reason make it all too much.  
With a strange fatality,  
Broke the spirits of a lesser man,  
Some other race can see,  
In his way he was the only one,  
In his way he was the only one.  
  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man.  
Now that it's time to decide,  
In his time he was a total man,  
Taken from Caesar's side,  
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong.  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,

But just to where, well, it's all been arranged  
Just passing through but the break must be made  
Should we move on or stay safely away?  
  
Through childlike ways, rebellion and crime  
To reach this point and retreat back again  
The broken hearts, all the wheels that have turned  
The memories scarred and the vision is blurred  
  
Just passing through 'til we reach the next stage  
But just to where, well, it's all been arranged  
Just passing through but the break must be made  
Should we move on or stay safely away?

1376,Joy Division,Glass,"Hearts fail, young hearts fail  
Anytime, pressurised  
Overheat, overtired  
Take it quick, take it neat  
Clasp your hands, touch your feet  
Take it quick, take it neat  
  
Hearts fail, young hearts fail  
Anytime, wearing down  
On the run, underground  
Put your hand where it's safe  
Leave your hand where it's safe  
Do it again  
Do it again and again and again  
  
Anytime, that's your right  
Told ya we should do it again  
Overheat, overtired  
Don't you wish to do it again  
Anytime, that's all right  
Don't you wish to do it again  
I bet you wish you do it again  
Do it again  
  
In the Genetic demo version the previous verse is replaced by,  
Anytime, that's your right  
Bet you wish you'd done it again  
Anytime, that's your right  
Turn around and do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again and again and again

1377,Joy Division,Gutz,"... 3, 4 warsaw!  
Don't talk to me girl, you know it's not nice.  
Don't laugh at murder, I won't pay the price.  
The facts are too high-powered, so sickened thrill,  
I'd give that mess up 'cos it makes you so ill.  
  
Blame bad things on me, whatever you do.  
When I come home I will be different from you.  
You're such a chictalk, you're really trussed up.  
Don't wanna talk to you, just left me your mum.  
  
Don't be a puppet, always rush you around.  
One just for you photo, try and tire me down.  
I won't tell him I talk like this all night,  
He must be worried 'cos you're sounding so trite.  
  
Respect is only normal, the way to our lives.  
Ever tried to sleep around with a bed for a wife.  
We'll never change you, if you start acting that way.  
If do keep mouths all open, I'll never get a say.  
You know what's special, it's as dark as I say.  
Can you see me, just ourselves,  
No comment, copycat!

"
1378,Joy Division,Heart And Soul,"Instincts that can still betray us,  
A journey that leads to the sun,  
Soulless and bent on destruction,  
A struggle between right and wrong.  
  
You take my place in the showdown,  
I'll observe witha pitiful eye,  
I'll humbly ask for forgiveness,  
A request well beyond you and I.  
  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
  
An abyss that laughs at creation,  
A circus complete with all fools,  
Foundations that lasted the ages,  
Then ripped apart at their roots.  
  
Beyond all this goo's is the terror,  
The grip of a mercenary hand,  
When savagery turns all good reason,  
There's no turning back, no last stand.  
  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
  
Existence well what does it matter?  
I exist on the best terms I can.  
The past is now part of my future,  
The present is well out of hand.  
The present is well out of hand.  
  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.  
One will burn, one will burn.  
Heart and soul, one will burn.

1379,Joy Division,I Remember Nothing,"We were strangers.  
We were strangers, for way too long, for way too long,  
We were strangers, for way too long.  
Violent, violent,  
Were strangers.  
  
Get weak all the time, may just pass the time,  
Me in my own world, yeah you there beside,  
The gaps are enormous, we stare from each side,  
We were strangers for way too long.  
  
Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair,  
Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair,  
Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon,  
Me in my own world, the one that you knew,  
For way too long.  
We were strangers, for way too long.  
We were strangers,  
We were strangers, for way too long.  
For way too long.

1380,Joy Division,In A Lonely Place,"Caressing the marble and stone,  
Love that was special for one,  
The waste in the fever I heat,  
How I wish you were here with me now.  
  
Body that curls in and dies,  
And shares that awful daylight,  
Warm like a dog round your feet,  
How I wish you were here with me now.  
  
Hangman looks round as he waits,  
Cord stretches tight then it breaks,  
Someday we will die in your dreams,  
How I wish we were here with you now.

1381,Joy Division,Inside The Line,"Hey! You! You too!  
I could make the choice for you.  
Just sticks close to you, it's all around me,  
Everything I try to do.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
But you think you're number 1, hey!  
Act as tho' them dinner's gone.  
  
You! Carried in a room for one. You too!  
Darkness when the lights are on.  
Turn me on for good, it's so exciting.  
Slogans on the wall don't need no underlining.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
Tackles you in fantasy. Hey!  
Hoping for some time to breathe.  
You! Some might get your corpse to easy. You too!  
I just want some time to breathe.  
Just sticks close to you, it's all around me.  
Everything I do, they're always trying to crowd me.  
I can't even seem to find the room to move.  
  
Watching every move you make. Hey!  
Choice of one that's hard to take. You!  
In fact it's just a big mistake. You too!  
In fact they make it feel like you.  
Maggots swarm inside the line. Hey!  
Ready for the perfect crime.  
Say you there is no right or wrong. You too!  
I don't know what's right or wrong.  
I don't know what's right or wrong.

"
1382,Joy Division,Interzone,"I walked through the city limits,  
Someone talked me in to do it,  
Attracted by some force within it,  
Had to close my eyes to get close to it,  
Around a corner where a prophet lay,  
Saw the place where she'd had a room to stay,  
A wire fence where the children played  
Saw the bed where the body lay,  
And I was looking for some friends of mine.  
And I had no time to waste.  
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.  
  
The cars screeched hear the sound on dust,  
Heard a noise just a car outside,  
Metallic blue turned red with rust,  
Pulled in close by the building's side,  
In a group all forgotten youth,  
Had to think, collect my senses now,  
Are turned on to a knife edged view  
Find some places where my friends don't know,  
And I was looking for a friend of mine,  
And had no time to waste.  
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.  
  
Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same,  
Getting darker now, faces look the same,  
And I walked round and round.  
No stomach, torn apart,  
Nail me to a train.  
Had to think again,  
trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out!  
Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out.

"
1383,Joy Division,Isolation,"In fear every day, every evening,  
He calls her aloud from above,  
Carefully watched for a reason,  
Painstaking devotion and love,  
Surrendered to self preservation,  
From others who care for themselves.  
A blindness that touches perfection,  
But hurts just like anything else.  
  
Isolation, isolation, isolation.  
  
Mother I tried please believe me,  
I'm doing the best that I can.  
I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through,  
I'm ashamed of the person I am.  
  
Isolation, isolation, isolation.  
  
But if you could just see the beauty,  
These things I could never describe,  
These pleasures a wayward distraction,  
This is my one lucky prize.  
  
Isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation, isolation.

"
1384,Joy Division,Leaders Of Men,"Born from some mother's womb,  
Just like any other room.  
Made a promise for a new life.  
Made a victim out of your life.  
  
When your time's on the door,  
And it drips to the floor,  
And you feel you can touch,  
All the noise is too much,  
And the seeds that are sown,  
Are no longer your own.  
  
Just a minor operation,  
To force a final ultimatum.  
Thousand words are spoken loud,  
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd.  
  
When you walk down the street,  
And the sound's not so sweet,  
And you wish you could hide,  
Maybe go for a ride,  
To some peep show arcade,  
Where the future's not made.  
  
A nightmare situation,  
Infiltrate imagination,  
Smacks of past Holy wars,  
By the wall with broken laws.  
  
The leaders of men,  
Born out of your frustration.  
The leaders of men,  
Just a strange infatuation.  
The leaders of men,  
Made a promise for a new life.  
No savior for our sakes,  
To twist the internees of hate,  
Self induced manipulation,  
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation.

"
1385,Joy Division,Love Will Tear Us Apart,"When routine bites hard,  
And ambitions are low,  
And resentment rides high,  
But emotions won't grow,  
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads.  
  
Then love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
  
Why is the bedroom so cold?  
You've turned away on your side.  
Is my timing that flawed?  
Our respect runs so dry.  
Yet there's still this appeal  
That we've kept through our lives.  
  
But love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
  
You cry out in your sleep,  
All my failings exposed.  
And there's a taste in my mouth,  
As desperation takes hold.  
Just that something so good just can't function no more.  
  
But love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.  
Love, love will tear us apart again.

"
1386,Joy Division,New Dawn Fades,"A change of speed, a change of style.  
A change of scene, with no regrets,  
A chance to watch, admire the distance,  
Still occupied, though you forget.  
Different colors, different shades,  
Over each mistakes were made.  
I took the blame.  
Directionless so plain to see,  
A loaded gun won't set you free.  
So you say.  
  
We'll share a drink and step outside,  
An angry voice and one who cried,  
'We'll give you everything and more,  
The strain's too much, can't take much more.'  
Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire,  
Can't seem to feel it anymore.  
It was me, waiting for me,  
Hoping for something more,  
Me, seeing me this time, hoping for something else.

"
1387,Joy Division,No Love Lost,"So long sitting here,  
Didn't hear the warning.  
Waiting for the tape to run.  
We've been moving around in different situations,  
Knowing that the time would come.  
Just to see you torn apart,  
Witness to your empty heart.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
  
Through the wire screen, the eyes of those standing outside looked in  
At her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo.  
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument  
Which they had that morning inserted deep into her body.  
She shuddered  
Instinctively.  
No life at all in the house of dolls.  
No love lost.  
No love lost.  
  
You've been seeing things,  
In darkness, not in learning,  
Hoping that the truth will pass.  
No life underground, wasting never changing,  
Wishing that this day won't last.  
To never see you show your age,  
To watch until the beauty fades,  
I need it.  
I need it.  
I need it.  
  
Two-way mirror in the hall,  
They like to watch everything you do,  
Transmitters hidden in the walls,  
So they know everything you say is true,  
Turn it on,  
Don't turn it on,  
Turn it on.

"
1388,Joy Division,Novelty,"When people listen to you don't you know it means a lot,  
'Cause you've got to work so hard for everything you've got.  
Can't rest on your laurels now,  
Not when you've got none.  
You'll find yourself in a gutter,  
Right back where you came from.  
  
Someone told me being in the know is the main thing.  
We all need the security that belonging brings.  
Can't stand on your own in these times,  
Against all the odds,  
You all just fall behind like all the other sods.  
  
You slap our backs and pretend you knew about,  
All the things that we were gonna do.  
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do,  
When it's over?  
  
You're on your own now,  
Don't you think that's a shame?  
But you're the only one responsible to take the blame.  
So what ya gonna do when the novelty has gone?  
Yeah, what ya gonna do when the novelty has gone?  
  
You slap our backs,  
And pretend you knew about,  
All the things we were gonna do.  
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do  
When its over?

"
1389,Joy Division,Passover,"This is a crisis I knew had to come,  
Destroying the balance I'd kept.  
Doubting, unsettling and turning around,  
Wondering what will come next.  
Is this the role that you wanted to live?  
I was foolish to ask for so much.  
Without the protection and infancy's guard,  
It all falls apart at first touch.  
  
Watching the reel as it comes to a close,  
Brutally taking it's time,  
People who change for no reason at all,  
It's happening all of the time.  
Can I go on with this train of events?  
Disturbing and purging my mind,  
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done,  
I know that I'll lose every time.  
  
Moving along in our God given ways,  
Safety is sat by the fire,  
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles,  
Left with a mark on the door,  
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?  
Forgive and forget's what they teach,  
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more,  
And watch as they drop by the beach.  
  
This is the crisis I knew had to come,  
Destroying the balance I'd kept,  
Turning around to the next set of lives,  
Wondering what will come next.

"
1390,Joy Division,Shadowplay,"To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you,  
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you,  
I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you,  
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth.  
  
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more,  
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor,  
And with cold steel, odor on their bodies made a move to connect,  
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left.  
  
I did everything, everything I wanted to,  
I let them use you for their own ends,  
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.  
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.

"
1391,Joy Division,She's Lost Control,"Confusion in her eyes that says it all.  
She's lost control.  
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,  
She's lost control.  
  
And she gave away the secrets of her past,  
And said I've lost control again,  
And a voice that told her when and where to act,  
She said I've lost control again.  
  
And she turned around and took me by the hand and said,  
I've lost control again.  
And how I'll never know just why or understand,  
She said I've lost control again.  
  
And she screamed out kicking on her side and said,  
I've lost control again.  
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.  
She said I've lost control.  
  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.  
  
Well I had to 'phone her friend to state my case,  
And say she's lost control again.  
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,  
And said I've lost control again.  
  
But she expressed herself in many different ways,  
Until she lost control again.  
And walked upon the edge of no escape,  
And laughed I've lost control.  
  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.  
She's lost control again.  
She's lost control.

1392,Joy Division,Something Must Break,"Someone take these dreams away,  
That point me to another day,  
A duel of personalities,  
That stretch all true realities.  
  
That keep calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me.  
  
Where figures from the past stand tall,  
And mocking voices ring the halls.  
Imperialistic house of prayer,  
Conquistadors who took their share.  
  
That keep calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me.  
  
Calling me, calling me, calling me, calling me.  
  
They keep calling me,  
Keep on calling me,  
They keep calling me,  
They keep calling me.

I used the tactics, make everybody pay  
Just something that I knew I had to do  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you  
  
Oh, I keep it all clean, I've paid the graces there  
No kings of misuse, no sellers of flesh  
Just something that I knew I had to do

1395,Joy Division,The Sound Of Music,"See my true reflection,  
Cut off my own connections,  
I can see life getting harder,  
So sad is this sensation,  
Reverse the situation,  
I can't see it getting better.  
  
I'll walk you through the heartbreak,  
Show you all the out takes,  
I can't see it getting higher,  
Systematically degraded,  
Emotionally a scapegoat,  
I can't see it getting better.  
  
Perverse and unrealistic,  
Try to make it all sick,  
I can't see it getting better,  
Hollow now, I'm burned out,  
All I need to break out,  
I can't see life getting higher,

Higher, higher, higher, higher,  
Higher, higher, higher, higher,  
Love of life, makes you feel higher.

"
1396,Joy Division,These Days,"Morning seems strange, almost out of place.  
Searched hard for you and your special ways.  
These days, these days.  
  
Spent all my time, learnt a killer's art.  
Took threats and abuse 'till I'd learned the part.  
Can you stay for these days?  
  
These days, these days.  
  
Used outward deception to get away,  
Broken heart romance to make it pay.  
  
These days, these days.  
  
We'll drift through it all, it's the modern age.  
Take care of it all now these debts are paid.  
Can you stay for these days?

"
1397,Joy Division,Twenty-Four Hours,"So this is permanent, love's shattered pride.  
What once was innocence, turned on its side.  
A cloud hangs over me, marks every move,  
Deep in the memory, of what once was love.  
  
Oh how I realized how I wanted time,  
Put into perspective, tried so hard to find,  
Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way.  
Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away.  
  
Excessive flash points, beyond all reach,  
Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep.  
Let's take a ride out, see what we can find,  
A valueless collection of hopes and past desires.  
  
I never realized the lengths I'd have to go,  
All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know.  
Just for one moment, I heard somebody call,  
Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all.  
  
Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong,  
Gottas find some therapy, this treatment takes too long.  
Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway,  
Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late.

"
1398,Joy Division,Walked In Line,"All dressed in uniforms so fine,  
They drank and killed to pass the time,  
Wearing the shame of all their crimes,  
With measured steps, they walked in line.

They walked in line,  
They walked in line,

They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,

Full of a glory never seen,  
They made it through the whole machine,  
To never question anymore,  
Hypnotic trance, they never saw,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,

1399,Joy Division,Wilderness,"I traveled far and wide through many different times,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the saints with their toys,  
What did you see there?  
I saw all knowledge destroyed.  
I traveled far and wide through many different times.  
  
I traveled far and wide through prisons of the cross,  
What did you see there?  
The power and glory of sin,  
What did you see there?  
The blood of Christ on their skins,  
I traveled far and wide through many different times.  
  
I traveled far and wide and unknown martyrs died,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the one sided trials,  
What did you see there?  
I saw the tears as they cried,  
They had tears in their eyes,  
  
Tears in their eyes,  
Tears in their eyes,  
Tears in their eyes.

Leading me to ruin - I should have traded you in  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
Don't know if I care - don't know if I'm there  
I just sit and stare - making love to thin air  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
Na na na na na na na na no good --  
  
I do lots of good - surprised at what you would  
Don't call me no crud - I really think I'm good  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
Try to call the tune - I'll probably go and rue it  
I'll just get it groomed - all sorts of other clues  
Yeah you're being insulted but you're no good for me  
  
I get by the local peer group and their pressures  
I can wash the dishes - my soups can taste delicious  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me  
  
I've forgotten how you feel - to me you're looking real  
Come on let's make a deal - think of where you live  
Yeah you think you're something but you're no good for me

1401,Pet Shop Boys,Friendly Fire,"An inspirational tirade against me How to explain my life?  
Boys to the left of me girls to the right of me neither husband nor wife  
Though the days are filled with pain there is no one who'll explain why  
I'm coming under friendly fire  
Shot in the fatal cause of rock-and-roll but there's nothing, really nothing,
to say  
  
Why I endure under force majeure slander without shame or tact  
I who studied make-up, mime and Buddha who taught two generations to react  
About me the critics lied I ignored them and survived  
In spite of coming under friendly fire shot in the fatal  
Cause of rock-and-roll I have nothing, really nothing, to deny  
When I look back my eyes are filled with tears  
Danger to mascara, applause to my peers  
When fame sustained me and arenas acclaimed me  
I floated through life in a cloud of love and insanity and pagan profanity  
Before a worshiping crowd Now my status is ill-defined  
  
As an icon I'm inclined to be coming under friendly fire  
Shot in the fatal cause of rock-and-roll  
But whatever dull or clever points they've scored  
I have never, oh no never, been ignored

Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
She's wearin' plaid and jeans  
Like a workman on the road  
Hitchin' out west  
With a personal stereo  
Playin' ""Lay, lady, lay""  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
Whatever boys say  
Girls don't cry  
In her heart she's not even a renegade  
From the start she knew  
Why she would not be saved  
All her instincts lead a different way  
In the pocket by her heart  
Is a dog-eared Polaroid  
A picture of a girl with her arm 'round a boy  
Who went missing the final day  
Whatever boys say

1405,Pet Shop Boys,Happiness Is An Option,"It is not easy  
It is not easy  
  
Looking from a window  
At the back of a house  
At the edge of a town  
It's gray  
Like the day  
When I lost it  
Clouds overhead  
I talked to a flower  
That was almost dead  
My body a prison  
Why did I do it?  
Someone told me not to  
But still went through it  
  
[Chorus]  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
Needed somewhere to clear  
My head  
Find some strength  
A warmer bed  
Maximum love in a  
Minimal world  
I'd never achieved it  
But then I believed it  
So when I lost it, how?  
I'm not sure now,  
It was a strange feeling  
Like a paw repealing itself  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I can wake up in the morning  
And not believe what I see  
Look in the mirror  
And think if that's really me  
I don't think I suit my face  
It's not a catastrophe  
It's more a philosophy  
Like the Russians  
Wondering why  
We're born under a blue sky  
But die in a dark forest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
This is neither old nor new  
It's always, forever  
Somewhere between sense  
And ambition  
Pleasure and decision  
We have to make a choice  
What do we want?  
Everyone singing  
""War, what is it good for?""  
While planning the next one?  
  
I don't need to win  
You don't have to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
The war within us  
But it gets easier  
The more we learn  
I don't need to win  
You don't need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But don't give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
I don't need to win  
You don't need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option

when the dream has come true

to return to when you can't  
face the world and you need

We all make a mess  
of our lives from time to time  
It's part of the process  
that you stumble as you climb  
And if you ever feel  
the pain is far too big a deal  
I say with pride  
I'll be on your side  
  
You've got a home here

Someone preaches ugly manners

All feelings blunted, all passion spent  
Everybody does what everybody does

1411,Pet Shop Boys,I Get Along,"Feeling like I'm stuck in a hole  
Body and soul  
While you're out of control  
Now I know why you had to go  
Well I think we both know  
Why it had to be so  
I've been trying not to cry  
When I'm in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that don't include you  
  
[Chorus]  
I get along, get along  
Without you very well  
I get along very well  
  
Now I know you'd much rather be  
With rock royalty  
Instead of someone like me  
The big boys are back and we need them, you said  
Think it was something you'd read  
And it stuck in your head  
Even though I don't suppose  
That's as far as it goes  
You've go quite an appetite  
For being wronged and in the right  
Well from now on it won't affect me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The morning after the night before  
I'd been alerted  
To your lies  
I phoned you up  
Your calls were all diverted  
Took a long time to track you down  
Even then you were defiant  
It's not what you think it is, you said  
And proceeded to deny it  
  
So I lost my patience at last  
And it happened so fast  
You belong in the past  
I've been trying not to cry  
When I'm in the public eye  
Stuck here with the shame  
And taking  
My share of the blame  
While making  
Sudden plans that don't include you

Imagine my surprise  
You were sitting close to him  
Staring in each other's eyes  
  
Each of you looked up  
But no one said a word  
I felt I should apologise  
For what I hadn't heard  
  
A silence filled the room  
Awkward as an elephant  
In the crowded court of your love  
I was now a supplicant  
  
And clumsy as I felt  
At stumbling on this theft  
To save further embarrassment  
I made my excuses and left  
  
So long ago  
I felt like such a fool  
For crying  
All that I know  
Is when you feel inside  
You're dying  
It all begins again  
Defying  
Your excuses

Flaunt that look

Somebody splendid really needed me  
Someone affectionate and dear  
Chaos would be ended if I knew that he  
Wanted to have me near

The most I've had is just a talent to amuse

And that is final  
You're not admitting  
You should be quitting  
All these  
Queens and fairies  
And muscle Marys  
The rough trade boyfriend  
Who in his pathetic own way  
Denies he's gay

Know what I'm thinking?  
Less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes and you'd feel  
A little less rough

Will you give me a chance  
And the status I need?

In six inch heels, quoting magazines  
Go all the way, you knew you could  
So far, so good  
  
Someone asked: Who do you think you are?  
Who pays your bills? How come you came this far?  
Shrugged him off, and locked the door  
So good, this far  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
We've drunk too much, and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong, I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here here  
  
I don't expect to talk in terms of sense  
Our dignity and injured innocence  
It contradicts your battle-scars  
Still healed, so far  
  
Now it almost seems incredible  
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone  
I may be wrong, but I thought we said  
It couldn't happen here  
  
Now it almost seems impossible  
We've found ourselves back where we started from

Lost beyond the pale  
I know you inside out  
I can tell the tale  
  
Across the sky the change of time  
Last night I lost all day  
I'm here and there or anywhere  
Away from Manderley  
  
And if I were the king of Rome  
I couldn't be more tragic  
My fate to roam so far from home  
In search of mindless magic  
  
Oh baby come back  
Oh baby come back to me  
  
The desert moon, a new lagoon  
We glide upon the surface  
Night falls fast, no shadows cast  
Arriving without purpose  
  
Oh baby call me  
Oh baby call me today  
  
And if I were the king of Rome  
I couldn't be more lonely  
With so much scope to dream and hope  
Someday you'll deign to phone me  
  
Oh baby call me  
Oh baby call me today  
  
I long for your inscrutable pale face  
I hunger for your beautiful embrace

1431,Pet Shop Boys,King's Cross,"The man at the back of the queue was sent  
To feel the smack of firm government  
Linger by the flyposter, for a fight

I've been hurt and we've been had  
You leave home, and you don't go back  
  
Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee  
  
Only last night I found myself lost  
By the station called King's Cross  
Dead and wounded on either side  
You know it's only a matter of time  
I've been good and I've been bad  
I've been guilty of hanging around  
  
Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter  
Wake up in the morning and there's still no guarantee  
  
So I went looking out today  
For the one who got away  
Murder walking round the block  
Ending up in King's Cross  
Good luck, bad luck waiting in a line  
It takes more than the matter of time  
  
Someone told me Monday, someone told me Saturday  
Wait until tomorrow and there's still no way  
Read it in a book or write it in a letter

1432,Pet Shop Boys,Left To My Own Devices,"I get out of bed at half past ten  
Phone up a friend, who's a party animal  
Turn on the news and drink some tea  
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping  
  
One day I'll read, or learn to drive a car  
If you pass the test, you can beat the rest  
But I don't like to compete, or talk street, street, street  
I can pick up the best from the party animal  
  
I could leave you, say goodbye  
Or I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
  
Pick up a brochure about the sun  
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw  
I was always told that you should join a club  
Stick with the gang, if you want to belong  
  
I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy  
In a world of my own at the back of the garden  
I didn't want to compete, or play out on the street  
For in a secret life I was a round head general  
  
I could leave you, say goodbye  
Or I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
Oh, I would  
  
I was faced with a choice at a difficult age  
Would I write a book? Or should I take to the stage?  
But in the back of my head I heard distant feet  
Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat  
  
It's not a crime when you look the way you do  
The way I like to picture you  
When I get home, it's late at night  
I pour a drink and watch the fight  
  
Turn off the TV, look at a book  
Pick up the phone, fix some food  
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day  
Waiting for the minute I hear you say  
  
I could leave you, say goodbye  
Or I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Come on, baby, say goodbye  
I could love you, if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices, I probably would  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
  
Out of bed, at half past ten  
The party animal phones a friend  
Picks up news about the sun  
And the working day has just begun  
  
Sticks with the gang - at the back of the street  
Pass the test - and don't compete  
  
Drive the car, if you're with me  
Che Guevara's drinking tea  
He reads about a new device  
And takes to the stage in a secret life  
  
(Aaaaaaaah... ...ce)  
  
Left to my own devices, I probably would  
If I was left to my own devices, I possibly would

They're raising an army in the North  
From York Minster to the Firth of Forth  
A pilgrimage of grace, you won't believe it  
Such a human face when you receive it  
  
And you will get over it  
With time to kill, you'll get over it  
  
There's a cruiser waiting at Scapa Flow  
To take you away from all you know  
The old man agonised  
He really has compromised  
  
Public opinion may not be on your side  
There are those who think they've been taken for a ride  
You'll get over it, I'm on your side because  
You'll get over it, and what a ride it was!

He wants to upgrade the mobile you own  
Have you realized your computer's a spy?  
Give him a ring, he'll explain why

And you, you'll get over it!

Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is

The coffee cup, I think about you  
I want you so, it's like I'm losing my mind  
  
The morning ends, I think about you  
I talk to friends and think about you  
And do they know it's like I'm losing my mind  
  
All afternoon doing every little chore  
The thought of you stays bright  
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor  
Not going left, not going right  
  
I dim the lights and think about you  
Spend sleepless nights to think about you  
You said you loved me, or were you just being kind  
Or am I losing my mind

To everyone  
  
You can live your life lonely  
Heavy as stone  
Live your life learning

You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

You can fly away to the end of the end of the world  
But where does it get you to?  
'Cause just when you least expect it  
Just what you least expect  
  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)  
Love comes quickly, whatever you do  
You can't stop falling (Ooh ooh)

It may seem romantic, and that's no defense  
Love will always get to you

1439,Pet Shop Boys,Love Is A Catastrophe,"Love is a catastrophe  
Look what it's done to me  
Brought me down here so low  
Stranded, nowhere to go  
  
No concentration  
Just rerunning conversation  
Trying to understand  
How I fell into this quicksand  
  
What happens next?  
With life I'm unimpressed  
Pain like a cutter's knife  
Never been lonelier in my life  
  
Who issued the instruction  
For this mad act of destruction?  
An end to equilibrium  
Fate laughs:  
Look what we've done to him!  
  
High wind through the trees  
Falling November leaves  
A weak sun hanging low  
Summer seems so long ago  
  
All my former dreams  
Tender romantic schemes  
Revealed as so naive  
To think I could believe  
  
In love as the kindest law  
Not as a declaration of war  
On my life and sanity  
Now I know at last for me  
Love is a catastrophe

Another night's begun  
It's always dark  
In Luna Park  
Wind across the moon  
Electric storms and soon  
A flying spark  
In Luna Park  
  
And when we're getting higher  
We're happy  
Somebody's eating fire  
We're happy  
The big wheel in the sky  
Will make you scream  
  
Come on, join a line  
The ghost train leaves on time  
It's always dark  
In Luna Park  
On the shooting range  
The plastic prizes never change  
So make your mark  
On Luna Park

To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon

A storm is coming soon  
Like dust on the moon  
  
Every night we go  
To the latest horror show  
And hear the screams  
In Luna dreams  
Fortune-tellers muse  
On palms that bode bad news  
The future's dark  
In Luna Park  
  
And when we're feeling scared  
We're happy  
With circuses and bread  
We're happy  
The whirling fair machines  
Are all we need  
  
Thunder. I wonder?  
A storm will come one day  
To blow us all away  
Like dust on the moon  
In Luna Park  
It can't be dark

1441,Pet Shop Boys,Memory Of The Future,"You seem to be inevitable to me  
Like a memory of the future  
I was and will be with you  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now I'm in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
You,you,you,you  
  
You unlock the past,  
So many scenes moving fast  
At last the right conclusion  
Or at least a sweet illusion  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now I'm in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you  
It's taking me all of my life  
It's taking me all of my life to find you

1442,Pet Shop Boys,Metamorphosis,"Please allow me to try and explain  
I'm living proof that man can change  
I knew what I wanted  
I knew how to get it  
  
It didn't make it happy so I started again  
What I wanted to be was a family man  
But nature had some alternative plans  
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold  
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
  
But every now and then  
Often at night  
A particular feeling would surface in spite  
Of what I told myself and tried to deny  
I kept on asking the question: why?  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
With time and age I had to change  
Cause my behaviour was getting strange  
People on the street caught my eye  
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy  
  
The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge  
Was in retreat and I was on the verge  
Of falling in love or having fun  
Time was running out  
Something had to be done  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason  
  
Where was I?  
Laying down the law  
Dancing with others  
Out on the floor  
  
Music and smoke  
What did it mean?  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream  
I had what I wanted  
  
Madly in love  
Nothing else mattered  
This was enough  
Questions were answered  
Which used to perplex  
In particular those about the big s.e.x.  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me what's the reason  
  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about love  
It's a metamorphosis  
  
Dreaming is easy  
Life is tough  
I got the picture  
The most important thing  
  
Is not to end up bitter  
Cause when you start to feel  
Increasingly forlorner  
Woomph! love comes  
Right around the corner  
  
It may not last  
But here am I  
Once a caterpillar  
Now a butterfly  
It can seem strange  
But when you reminisce  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis

You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
It's all about change  
It's a metamorphosis

Roses bloom more to adore you too

What to do about October  
How to smile behind a frown?

We must be very brave

My October symphony?  
Or as an indication

From revolution to revelation?

As leaves fall to the ground  
Because we've been thinking  
How October's let us down  
Then and now

December instead?  
Or worry about February?

But nervously we never get it  
Right  
From the start I approved of you  
Right from the moment you turned to face me

With a nervous laugh and a concentrated frown  
I spoke too fast with watchful eyes  
Of a recent past and some nostalgic surprise  
  
We don't talk of love

But nervously we wonder when and  
Smile  
Knowing why I approved of you

Heart is too much of everything

Brian never talks  
Help me in policks and sense in Arnold  
Tell me all about Reddocks

A little more rouge and powder cheeks  
But the base is pay off

Shining and souring like a requiem

Pouring over our photographs

I went for shelter to the temple  
Once inside I couldn't believe my eyes  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
Go to a club, you think I'll be there  
I don't go 'cause I'm not a member  
You said you went to apologize  
It's plain to me that's one more lie  
That's my impression [Repeats]  
  
I went looking for someone I couldn't find  
Staring at faces by the Serpentine  
Walking slowly, I realized  
You'd been and gone, I know you lied

I learned my lesson

1472,Pet Shop Boys,The Night I Fell In Love,"I was backstage  
Couldn't believe my luck was in  
I saw him approach  
Wearing a most approachable grin  
When he said hello  
I was surprised he spoke so politely  
I said I'd liked his show  
Well he just smiled  
I guess it happens nightly  
And so  
I fell in love  
  
We went to his room  
He had a video camera  
I was so nervous  
I had to try hard not to stammer  
He said  
'I'm glad you liked the show  
That crowd was dope out there tonight, alright  
You want to see some more?  
Well be my guest  
You can have a private performance'  
I'd fallen in love  
  
I didn't ask why  
Though he seemed like such a regular guy  
He said we could be  
Secret lovers  
Just him and me  
Then he joked  
'Hey, man!  
Your name isn't Stan, is it?  
We should be together!'  
And he was passionate  
I guess I would rate  
Him a nine out of ten  
By then  
I'd fallen in love  
  
When I asked  
Why have I heard so much  
About him being charged  
With homophobia and stuff  
He just shrugged  
  
Next morning we woke  
He couldn't have been a nicer bloke  
Over breakfast made jokes  
About Dre and his homies and folks  
Neither of us asked if or when  
We would see each other again  
But I thought that was cool  
'cause I was already late for school  
By then  
I'd fallen in love

1473,Pet Shop Boys,The Only One,"The only one  
  
I think of you  
And wonder who  
You are and what's your line  
I wonder if  
There's someone else  
Or if it's true that I'm  
The only one  
In your life  
I only worry  
For your own sake  
I don't know much about  
The deals you make  
There's so much that  
You hide from me  
The mystery:  
Am I the only one?  
The only one  
  
(The only one  
The only one  
The only one)  
  
I don't know you  
You don't know me  
I wonder what we share  
It's just that now  
And then you smile  
And suddenly I know you care  
And I'm the only one  
For a while  
Though you've many reasons  
To tell me a lie  
I can't help believing  
That I should be  
For you and you for me  
The only one  
  
(The only one)  
(Only one)  
  
As enigmatic  
As you can be  
I'm not suspicious  
Naturally  
There's so much that  
You hide from me  
The mystery:  
Am I the only one  
In your life?  
  
Though you've many reasons  
To tell me a lie  
I can't help believing  
That I should be  
For you and you for me  
The only one

1474,Pet Shop Boys,The Survivors,"Cross a windy bridge one winter night  
Past Embankment Gardens  
Enter warmth and light  
Face the music (it's never easy)  
Forget the chill  
Face the future (it's never easy)  
Find the will  
If live is worth living  
It's got to be done  
One might be forgiven  
For thinking it's a life on the run  
Many roads will cross through many lives  
But somehow you survive  
Look around  
Picture what's in store  
Is this the final edit  
Or is the subject now a bore?  
Don't shrug your shoulders (it's always easy)  
You can't ignore  
That life is worth living  
It's still worth a damn  
One might be forgiven for thinking  
It's something of a sham  
Many words may make it sound contrived  
But somehow we're alive  
(The Survivors)  
Our heads bowed  
(The Survivors)  
At memorials for other faces  
In the crowd  
Teachers and artists (it's never easy)  
And Saturday girls in suits or sequins  
(It's never easy)  
Or twinsets-and-pearls  
If life is worth living  
It's got to be run as a means of giving  
Not as a race to be won  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow we'll arrive  
Many roads will run through many lives  
But somehow we'll survive

1475,Pet Shop Boys,The Way It Used To Be,"I'm here, you're there  
Come closer, tonight I'm lonely  
Come here with me  
I want it the way it used to be  
  
What is left of love?  
Tell me, who would even care?  
So much time has passed  
I'd still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didn't drift away?  
  
I can remember days of sun  
We knew our lives had just begun  
We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young  
Under the moon, address unknown  
I can remember nights in Rome  
I thought that love would last, a promise set in stone  
  
I'd survive with only memories  
If I could change the way I feel  
But I want more than only memories  
A human touch to make them real  
  
Another day, another dream  
Over the bridge an empty scene  
We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream  
I don't know why we moved away  
Lost in the here and now we strayed  
Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed  
  
I was there, caught on Tenth Avenue  
You elsewhere with Culver City blues  
Then and there I knew that I'd lost you  
  
What is left of love?  
Tell me, who will even care?  
So much time has passed  
I'd still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didn't drift away?  
  
Don't give me all your love and pain  
Don't sell me New York in the rain  
Let's leave our promises behind  
Rewind and try again  
  
What remains in time that didn't fade away?  
Sometimes I need to see  
The way it used to be

1476,Pet Shop Boys,This Must Be The Place I Waited Years To Leave,"(Everybody E-E-Everybody  
Everybody E-E-Everybody  
Everybody E-E-Everybody  
Everybody jump to attention...)  
  
Each morning after Sunblest  
Feel the benefit, mental arithmetic  
I waited by the staffroom  
In time for benediction  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
  
To our voices nobody's listening  
We shiver in the rain by the touchline  
Then a coach ride to the station  
""My lord, the carriage awaiteth!""  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
And how  
How long?  
  
I'm listening to the words I thought I'd never hear again  
A litany of saints and other ordinary men  
Kneeling on the parquet  
Whatever has gone wrong?  
The fear and feeling hopelessness  
I don't want to belong  
  
I dreamt I was back in uniform  
And a candidate for examination  
History, someone had blundered  
And a voice rapped ""knuckle under!""  
Living a law just short of delusion  
When we fall in love there's confusion  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
This must be the place I waited years to leave  
And how  
And how  
How long?

1477,Pet Shop Boys,This Used To Be The Future,"I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Why don't we turn the whole bloody lot down  
And make a new start all over again?  
  
I can recall Utopian thinking  
Bold mission statements and tightening of belts  
Demolition of familiar landmarks  
Promises made and deals that were dealt  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Let's turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again  
  
But that future was exciting  
Science fiction made fact  
Now all we have to look forward to  
Is a sort of suicide pact  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face?  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space?  
  
I can remember planning for leisure  
Living in peace and freedom from fear  
Science that promised to make us a new world  
Religion and prejudice disappear  
  
I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
To threaten, oh God! Amen  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
Oh God! Amen  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face?  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space?  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Let's turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again

1478,Pet Shop Boys,To Face The Truth,"You know it hurts me when you lie  
Sometimes it even makes me cry  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
If you don't believe what I have said  
Take a look, my eyes are red  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
But all those sleepless night in bed  
When you've been out somewhere instead  
I wonder if you care and cannot bear the proof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
  
A lawyer with a case to prove  
Would sift the evidence, then move  
It's the only thing to do  
So why then can't I face the facts?  
Sift this evidence that backs  
I am so in love with you  
But all the nights when you have said  
You must be somewhere else instead  
I wonder where you go, but daren't expose the proof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
To face the truth  
  
You are the only one, the only one  
  
You know it hurts me when you lie  
Sometimes it even makes me cry  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
If you don't believe what I have said  
Take a look, my eyes are red  
'Cause I'm so in love with you  
But all the nights you don't show up  
I know it's time I should grow up  
I ask you if you care, you stand and stare aloof  
It hurts too much to face the truth  
To face the truth  
To face the truth

Look at us now together  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Saying hello to men friends  
Smiling across a friend's friends  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
We'll stand around forever  
Regardless of time or weather  
Ordering drinks at the bar  
  
Looking for love, and getting  
Nothing that's worth regretting  
But wondering why we travel so far  
  
To speak is a sin  
You look first, then stare  
And once in a while  
A smile, if you dare  
  
To speak is a sin  
You'd better beware  
But once in a while

From the twentieth century  
That I don't think we can just dismiss

Of inhumanity  
The lesson that I learned was this:  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together  
  
Well I bought a ticket  
To the revolution  
And I cheered when the statues fell  
Everyone came  
To destroy what was rotten  
But they killed off what was good as well  
  
Sometimes the solution  
Is worse than the problem  
Let's stay together  
  
Stay with me

Together we're better

Is worse than the problem

Up against it  
Wondering why we fought after all  
Such a cold winter with scenes  
As slow as Pinter  
Synchronise your watches  
There's still time to kill  
Up against it  
Drinking this swill to sweeten the pill  
Up against it  
The more that it hurts  
The less that it works  
Wrapped in nostalgia to queue for a show  
Back to Trafalgar one kiss then I'll go  
So deep in quicklime  
The bones of an old crime  
I knew a man who raked them over  
He's still suffering  
Up against it  
Buried so deep  
It gives me the creeps  
Up against it  
The longer you hate  
The more that it grates  
Up against it  
Look left then right  
And run for your Life  
Up against it  
The more that it hurts  
The less that it works

In my heart  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Every thought's a fashion  
Or a crime  
And every boy is just  
A waste of time  
But I pretend  
It was different then  
Maybe it's a habit  
Maybe it's a sin  
But I find out  
When I try it on  
It crawls beneath my skin  
Once it gets inside me  
It won't go  
Now I know  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
  
Rent  
Shopping  
Being boring  
It's alright  
It's a sin  
I'm not scared  
In denial  
I want a dog  
I want a lover  
Can you forgive her?  
Do I have to?  
What have I? What have I?  
What have I done to deserve this?  
  
We're the Pet Shop Boys  
We're the Pet Shop Boys

1494,Pet Shop Boys,"Yesterday, When I Was Mad","Darling, you were wonderful, you really were quite good  
I enjoyed that, though, of course, no one understood  
A word of what was going on, they didn't have a clue  
They couldn't understand your sense of humour like I do  
  
You're much too kind  
I smiled with murder on my mind  
  
Yesterday, when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
You have a certain quality, which really is unique  
Expressionless, such irony, although your voice is weak  
It doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud  
Of course it's all on tape, but no one will find out  
  
You hated me too  
But not as much as I hated you  
  
Yesterday, when I was mad  
And quite prepared to give up everything  
Admitting, I don't believe  
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me  
  
Then, when I was lonely  
I thought again  
And changed my mind  
  
Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners  
And argued about the hotel rooms, and where to go for dinner  
And someone said: ""It's fabulous you're still around today,  
You've both made such a little go a very long way""

1495,Pet Shop Boys,You Choose,"He's gone  
You've lost  
Stay behind  
And count the cost  
You try  
You lose  
You don't fall in love by chance  
You choose  
  
It's a decision  
Made over time  
Should you take a risk  
And start to climb  
The steepest hill  
Only to find  
Halfway there  
You've been left behind?  
  
Choosing to love  
Is risking a lot  
And trying to change  
And to give all you've got  
But don't pretend  
It comes out of the blue  
You take a chance  
And see it through  
And if it's refused  
What can you do?  
Continue hopefully?  
Start anew?  
  
Lick your wounds  
Buy your booze  
You won't get drunk by accident  
You'll choose  
Don't blame him  
For refusing your bid  
He didn't decide to love  
You did  
  
Learn the lesson  
Take the blows  
You didn't fall in love by chance  
You chose  
Play the sad songs  
Sing the blues  
You don't fall in love by chance  
You choose

Should I react or turn off the light?  
Looks like you're picking a fight  
In a blurring of wrong and right  
But how your mood changes  
You're a devil, now an angel  
Suddenly subtle and solemn and silent as a monk  
You only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
It's better than nothing  
I suppose  
Some doors have opened,  
Others closed  
But I couldn't see you exposed  
To the horrors behind some of those  
Somebody said: listen  
Don't you know what  
You're missing? You should be kissing him  
Instead of dissing him like a punk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
All of my friends keep asking me  
Why, oh why  
Do you not say goodbye?  
If you don't even try  
You'll be sunk  
?Cause you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
  
What's the meaning  
When you speak with so much feeling?  
Is it over when you're sober?  
Am I junk?  
You only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk  
But you only tell me you love me  
When you're drunk

Cross the line  
Raise a flag to a moral crime,  
We'll light a fire for this,  
Make the papers by morning time  
And lay in our bliss  
So come on darling and share my mind,  
There is no need to stay hid  
'cause all we are now is two of a kind  
Can you believe what we did?  
And I'll say it again, oh, and I'll say it again  
That when the power comes between us  
Oh, I'll know what to do,  
I'm gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight  
Take this chance and show your might  
All world's on the other side  
Cross the line  
Mother come to me now,  
Take this hand now, I'm afraid  
Mother, come to me  
I'm bleeding  
We had no way to see eye to eye  
Through all the walls in their mind  
These were the pleasures that terrified  
We left them behind  
And I'll say it again, and I'll say it again  
And if the power comes between us  
Oh, I'll know what to do,  
I'm gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight,  
Take this chance and show your might,  
All the world's on the other side,  
Cross the line

1505,Spandau Ballet,Empty Spaces,"Once there were times, love when we could touch the air between  
And out across this room we'd fill the space with all our skins  
And if we just touch hands, life would shine with electric dreams  
No matter how many miles, nothing hurt long distance hearts  
And there was always something there that space could never keep apart  
But now I know inside that something's died  
When we're apart, all we have are empty spaces  
It's not like we're building walls, too hard to climb to make us blind  
It's just so much numbing space to hollow out the heart and mind  
And I can hear echoes of ghosts of love, we left behind  
I'll always love April, we fell in love and we planted seeds  
And now we walk through fallen trees and leaves are crushed beneath  
And I will always live in autumn  
Now we're agreed, all we have are empty spaces  
I thought this was meant to be our love had an energy  
But only as time evolved and all of our strength dissolved  
And we'll never feel the flame that burned so naked again  
I walk through Kentish Town and all the rain, rain pouring down  
So many people here but space like this I've never found  
And as I get back home and step inside  
I realize, all I have, all I have are empty spaces

So stir this cocktail, shake me up  
Drink me down and take me from the bar

Build a foundation  
You know we got to build, build it up  
Spent the night in Tumbledown  
A hundred miles from west of town  
Plans were laid, no compromise was made  
Gently up to meet the blue  
Left a note and signed it ""True""  
Those construction games were all we played  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Yeah we're gonna build, build it up  
Oh, I know you're gonna give your best  
So more or less, gotta put it to the test  
Don't you know, you've got the whole world in your hands  
Surrender up and lay down your arms  
The fightin' hurts but the lovin' calms  
Oh, I know you've got the whole world in your hands

Gold rising June in the blue of my eye  
I've still sleep in my eyes

Send for the soul you can soon realize  
I've still sleep in my eyes, I've still sleep in my eyes

These are my salad days

Nothing left to make me feel small  
Luck has left me standing so tall

You're indestructible, always believe in...

I hope you find a little more time  
Remember we were partners in crime  
It's only two years ago  
The man with the suit and the face  
You knew that he was there on the case  
Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you  
And love is like a high prison wall  
But you could leave me standing so tall

1510,Spandau Ballet,Handful Of Dust,"Your pressed your face against my heart  
I felt that you could look right through me  
We live in days that have no time  
We live in times that now refuse me  
And somewhere out beyond his town  
There lies a world that now can turn us round  
And we need it and we need it  
Oh, got to have some thing to believe in

What can I give just to know that it's true?

How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust?  
I feel to thin before your eyes  
I feel so naked under open skies  
I once stood tall within this town  
But now the time has come to bring us down  
We must have more with his power in hand  
We must believe things will go as we planned  
But I've gotta begin to say  
Now they've taken my pride in this way  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust, with a handful of dust ?  
Making love through electric skies  
Now I know where my fortune lies  
Breathe the air and feel this land  
'Cause it's slipping through me like dust from my hand  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo

Forever screaming all the day and night  
She used to be a diplomat  
But now she's down the laundromat  
They washed her mind and now she finds it hard  
I know her name  
But now she never seems the same

Because she's highly strung

Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
She's stepping out upon the ledge  
She's got a gun against her head  
She's wired up to blow the power line  
She's walking out upon the knife  
She'll take you to the edge of life  
Just like the song, the pressure is on again  
I know her name  
Ho, but now she never seems the same  
She don't talk to me

1518,Spandau Ballet,Missionary,"The bells ring out above my room  
And announcement of our loss  
And in the act, three men decide  
An indefinite epilogue  
My letters have all gone  
A journey that's unsure  
A message that was rich  
A hand that was poor  
Oh, have me, breath and let me go  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
Oh, I don't want you, want you, want you  
My own description may have failed  
Torn from pictures that were saved  
Along with images from words  
That were saved and not erased  
The shelves arranged above my head  
A memory of my fears  
Blankets hold the smell of life  
And soak the many years  
Oh, have me, breath and let me go  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
Oh, I don't want you, want you, want you

Sun doesn't burn when the water comes  
But water doesn't come like the English rain  
They bury their heads for self defense  
A marked improvement through diligence  
We are alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Vacant rooms that are full of men  
That sit on the stools awaiting time  
Discussion leads to little sense  
They bury their heads for self defense  
We are alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins

Remember who's looking  
'cause baby I'm that something inside

You give something something I need.

But harder to tame

This is the nature of the beast  
It is the glowing in his eyes  
It is the reason for his lies  
Oh, how many know you're there  
Oh, how many play your game  
He's always the man to dare  
You're always to blame  
It is the need to understand  
Oh, it is the trigger in his hand  
It lives in the uniform  
It grows from the need to gain  
With faces so old and torn  
It's calling your name  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
It lives in the red-alert  
It lives in the power game  
It's easy to take to heart  
But harder to tame  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast

This is the nature of the beast

1522,Spandau Ballet,Only When You Leave,"Layin' in the after glow  
I only want to learn what you know  
But now you're leavin'  
How many hearts must you break  
And how many calls must I make  
  
But now you're leavin'  
In this world all that I choose has come unbearable  
But love is in your touch  
Ooh, it's killing me so much  
  
Chorus:  
  
Oh only when you leave  
I'll need to love you  
And when the action has all gone  
I'm just a little fool enough to need you  
A fool enough too long  
Only when you leave, you'll leave in danger  
Ooh, I'll make sure that you pay  
So give a little passion to a stranger  
And take this soul away  
  
I only want to make this things last  
So how could this have gone so fast  
And now you're leavin'  
How many times must I learn  
It's only when you've gone that I burn  
  
And now you're leavin'  
In the end, all that is left has come unbearable  
It's hard to change your mind  
So leave it all behind

Always in time, but never in line for dreams.  
Head over heels when toe to toe.  
This is the sound of my soul,

Always slipping from my hands,  
Sand's a time of its own.  
Take your seaside arms and write the next line.

1530,Spandau Ballet,Windy Town,"There's gotta be something more to this life we're given  
Gotta be peace o' mind and a piece o' living  
When the losers have won and the damage is done  
Only then will you be saved  
She dancing on thin ice while her mind is skating  
He's building on the dust that is suffocating  
And a baby that cries in a city of lies  
For a freedom that is craved  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Sunny had a street that she couldn't live in  
Sunny had a room that she couldn't breath in  
But a heart that could feel and a hand that could heal  
And a passion filled with rage  
I never felt the air with a wind of change  
I only felt a storm with a wind and rain  
A city so deep, a soul without sleep  
And a heart that's filled with pain  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Look out on a million dreams  
There's fire in all those schemes  
I feel the burn of investigation  
Love will be your inspiration  
Baby, lets go again  
On me and you it all depends  
The power of love is a powerful friend  
And I will love you till the end  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow around  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Baby, through Windy Town

The one that I love but can never find.

1532,Squeeze,A Moving Story,"She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
Her life was changed in an instant  
The van was filled up  
And tied to the rack  
Her home that now seemed so distant  
Kissing goodbye  
To her friends on the stairs  
She felt a loss deep within her  
Sat in the front seat with stuff everywhere  
The neighbours said they would ring her  
They moved to the sea front  
And loved their new view  
Of tides coming in on the shingle  
She and her daughter  
Found new things to do  
At last it was good to be single  
And in the summer  
The place came alive  
Lights on the pier in the evening  
The fresh sea air  
And could cut with a knife  
Such a wonderful feeling  
  
She worked in a pub  
Where bands would appear  
On a tiny stage in the corner  
She watched them load in  
With tattered old gear  
The place would get like a sauna  
London had gone now  
Her new life was strong  
She found herself a new karma  
She fell for a man  
Who played with a band  
And took her life from it's drama  
  
She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
The past was neatly extinguished  
He was much younger  
But she lived with that  
He struggled hard with his english  
She felt his loving  
And proudly reclaimed  
All of the warmth she'd been lacking  
They lay in bed  
Looking out at the rain  
No more moving or packing  
  
She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
Her life had changed in an instant

The giver of delight  
I took the drug  
And went out like a light  
I giggled on the bed  
As I stared at the wall  
I was the one who felt ever so small  
I couldn't take it  
I couldn't win with my thoughts  
Forever playing chess  
And keeping reports  
On whatever I saw  
And whatever moved  
I was emperor for an hour  
I had nothing else to do  
  
The universe caved in  
My legs fell away  
I took the drug but you didn't say  
That I would be you and you would be me  
When I took the pill  
That put me to sleep  
I couldn't take it  
I couldn't spin all the plates  
Forever in a mind field of personal games  
What could I do  
I was Caesar of Rome  
Thank God I woke up  
To find you had come home

With the way that you left me

The hurt and the anger  
And the joy of the pain  
Now knowing I am single  
They'll be fire in my eyes  
And a stain on my notebook  
For a new love tonight  
From the lips without passion  
To the lips with a kiss  
There's nothing of your love  
That I'll ever miss  
The stain on my notebook  
Remain all that's left  
Of the memory of late nights  
And coffee in bed  
Now she's gone  
And I'm back on the beat  
A stain on my notebook  
Says nothing to me  
Now she's gone  
And I'm out with a friend  
With lips full of passion  
And coffee in bed

1538,Squeeze,Bonkers,"I know that I'm bonkers  
Stupidity conquers  
Forgive me I know not what I do  
The cunning behavior  
Takes up every acre  
Of emotional cage in the zoo  
You know how it goes  
The volcano blows  
Eruptions hold the duvet down  
The words on the lips  
The sticking out ribs  
As I try to push my weight around  
  
I'm sorry please witness  
This act of forgiveness  
It's all I can do for her to see  
That I was the sad case  
A mouse in the rat race  
Won't somebody pass me the cheese  
  
The size of her breasts  
Like woodpeckers nests  
Would comfort me on winter nights  
The brains in my pants  
Create milli amps  
Of pleasure with seconds of delight  
  
I'm bonkers believe me  
A Federico Fellini  
I'm swinging on the windmills of my mind  
Where I have been ground down  
I'm still walking down town  
I'm leaving all this madness behind  
  
Laid back on the couch  
With me the old slouch  
For an Oscar on the silent screen  
There's no time to waste  
As I fill my fat face  
With a pizza slice and custard cream  
  
I'm sorry I hurt you  
I'm bonkers believe me

Now and then when your heart's in pain

1540,Squeeze,Can Of Worms,"She was married and then divorced  
Things seemed to happen that way  
The children were confused, sometimes they'd fight  
Sitting in their toys and games  
To them she's mother and I am their friend  
Who sits with them on his lap  
And sleeps on the sofa on alternate weekends  
No substitute for their dad  
She's a very good mum  
As she tries to explain  
Everything that she can  
But a child's mind is sharp  
They imagine the worst  
Sometimes can't understand  
That there's so much to learn  
When you open a can of worms  
  
So to the park to play on the swings  
To give their mother a break  
When I saw their father walking down the path  
Heading down towards the gate  
I froze on the spot, heart in my throat  
I hoped he'd not see us there  
He soon disappeared and the kids on the slide  
Were happy and unaware  
  
I read the papers and made scrambled eggs  
The kids got ready to leave  
Their father was taking them for the weekend  
With pocket money and sweets  
They were excited as they waved goodbye  
And I went straight back to bed  
Their mother stood and watched as they drove away  
Standing on the front door step

"
1541,Squeeze,Christmas Day,"Mary and Joseph drove into town,  
Searching for a place to stay.  
The moon was up, and his foot was down  
A miracle was on its way.  
  
They tried the hotels, the motels, the bed-and-breakfast  
Locals, but no one seemed to have any room.  
  
Better find a double room soon!  
  
[Chorus]  
So where would Christmas be without  
Mary and Joseph?  
Walk of the Wise?  
Laurel and holly?  
Cracker Surprise?  
Lights on the pine tree?  
And more aftershave?  
I'm not forgetting Jesus who was born on Christmas Day!  
  
They found a place with the neon lights  
TV, Pool, and Vacancies  
The man at the desk didn't hear them right  
When the two of them booked for three.  
  
They watched the TV  
And deeply, she thought about the needing  
Of the heavens to deliver this way  
And it happened on Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mary and Joseph were so surprised  
With admirers around the crib  
There was something in their son's eyes  
They identically took one in.  
  
Like a Messiah, and a Fire  
Like the tread around a tire  
That grip all roads  
It's to bond you there.  
  
And it happened on Christmas Day!  
Christmas day.  
Christmas day.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
""Not forgetting Jesus.""

1542,Squeeze,Cigarette Of A Single Man,"The cigarette of a single man  
Burns in the ashtray by his bed  
He pulls the ring of another can  
And holds it up beside his head  
The book he reads is on the floor  
He's read it several times before  
What you got to go home to?  
  
The cigarette of a single man  
Sits in the ashtray on the bar  
He sits and sifts through several plans  
But knows alone he won't go far  
He needs the love another has  
To help him, if another can  
  
The cigarette of a single man  
Lays in the gutter by his side  
Now he's one of those little lambs  
Who strayed too far from the flock to find  
He's better off without the grief  
That people wear between their teeth  
  
And in his mouth as he's asleep  
The cigarette of a single man

"
1543,Squeeze,Cold Shoulder,"My head was stuck in the cat flap on the door  
Where I could see her walking on the kitchen floor  
Down on my knees  
Just like a dog  
Begging for scraps that she said she hadn't got  
She took her pen she poked me in the eye  
As through the lock I looked to see my world inside  
I kicked and swore  
Void of all brain  
I couldn't see that I was the one to blame  
  
Cold shoulder  
Like a slaughtered cow in a butcher's fridge  
Cold shoulder  
She had laid the plans where we built our bridge  
To a better life  
Cold shoulder  
  
I had been chased by a hairbrush that she threw  
Life was blurred when the hand of fate came into view  
It smacked my face  
I was released  
I came back home where life became a feast  
  
Cold shoulder  
Like a slaughtered cow in a butcher's fridge  
Cold shoulder  
She had laid the plans where we built our bridge  
To a better life  
Cold shoulder  
Then I fell over  
Into a bush

"
1544,Squeeze,Cool For Cats,"The Indians send signals  
From the rocks above the pass  
The cowboys take positions  
In the bushes and the grass  
  
The squaw is with the corporal  
She is tied against the tree  
She doesn't mind the language  
It's the beating she don't need  
  
She lets loose all the horses  
When the corporal is asleep  
And he wakes to find the fire's dead  
And arrows in his hat  
  
And davy crockett rides around  
And says it's cool for cats  
The sweeney's doing ninety  
'Cause they've got the word to go  
  
They get a gang of villains  
In a shed up at heathrow  
They're counting out the fivers  
When the handcuffs lock again  
  
In and out of wandsworth  
With the numbers on their names  
It's funny how their missus'  
Always look the bleeding same  
  
And meanwhile at the station  
There's a couple of likely lads  
Who swear like how's your father  
And they're very cool for cats  
They're cool for cats  
  
To change the mood a little  
I've been posing down the pub  
On seeing my reflection  
I'm looking slightly rough  
  
I fancy this, I fancy that  
I want to be so flash  
I give a little muscle  
And I spend a little cash  
  
But all I get is bitter and a nasty little rash  
And by the time I'm sober  
I've forgotten what I've had  
And everybody tells me that it's cool to be a cat  
Cool for cats  
  
Shake up at the disco  
And I think I've got a pull  
I ask her lots of questions  
And she hangs on to the wall  
  
I kiss her for the first time  
And then I take her home  
I'm invited in for coffee  
And I give the dog a bone  
  
She likes to go to discos  
But she's never on her own  
I said I'll see you later  
And I give her some old chat  
  
But it's not like that on the T.V.  
When it's cool for cats  
It's cool for cats

"
1545,Squeeze,Cupid's Toy,"He stalks the club with cupid's toy  
Foremost in his mind  
Jacks his body into shape  
And leaves the rest behind  
He has a pea for a brain  
A spud for a heart  
A scar on his cheek  
And a rubber duck in his bath  
This boy doesn't give love  
This boy doesn't get love  
  
He stalks the club with eagle eyes  
Springing on his heels  
Likes to throw a hand of dice  
Then hang them in his wheels  
He has a crease in his jeans  
A frown on his face  
The scent of a man  
Who thinks he has taste  
  
She smiles as he buys her a drink  
Standing at the end of the bar  
He feels helpless when she looks in his eyes  
Suddenly there's love in his heart  
  
He stalks the club with such a smile  
Forever on the move  
He takes pride in looking smart  
And knowing when to groove  
He has a heart on a chain  
His picture inside  
A ring in one ear  
Dark glasses at night

"
1546,Squeeze,Electric Trains,"When I was crowned a mummy's boy by friends I didn't like  
I made a meal of trips to school upon my father's bike  
I used to sit between his legs, perched on a piece of wood  
If it ever rained on us, I'd slip beneath his hood  
And at home the radio was on  
From Julie Andrews to Jerry Garcia  
Life was all fun and games  
I was out of my head and underneath my bed  
Playing with electric trains  
  
At home the stereo was on  
My head was filled with rock  
I played a willow cricket bat guitar  
And soloed round the clock  
My records stacked up in a pile  
Collected from the charts  
And Top of the Pops  
  
Kneeling with torchlight shining  
Before me in my bed  
My eyeballs stuck in readers wives  
Pubic hairs proudly counted everyday  
Manhood took me slowly  
Out into the milky way  
  
I chased the girls and made them cry  
My hair grew down my back  
The passing of my teenage years  
Were spent down in the sack  
I played guitar and formed a band  
I puked up all night long  
  
As people came to sit and stare  
While I raced through my songs  
The sound of music passed by me  
Just like the Grateful Dead

"
1547,Squeeze,Elephant Girl,"She's interested in me  
I'm interested in her  
But there's a distance  
Each morning as she walks  
Our eyes exchange a thought  
Our hearts, an interest  
I've seen her at the club  
Expanding with the funk  
She looks so brilliant  
She sticks close to her friends  
And when the music ends  
She is the Indian  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
I'm interested to meet  
The girl that looks at me  
I will be trying  
Her color unlike mine  
Her hair the plaited vine  
I will be climbing  
My leg is always pulled  
By friends who really would  
But say they wouldn't  
The joke's against my heart  
Immediately she's barred  
Their hearts are wooden  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
I'm interested in her  
She's interested in me  
Her distance shortens  
She walks towards the light  
I walk towards the lines  
That seem important  
I'm counting up to ten  
By five she's gone again  
Into the distance  
I'll try again to nudge my  
Courage for the love look  
Without resistance  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  

"
1548,Squeeze,F-Hole,"I wrote her name on a bar mat  
She had a peculiar bonnet,  
But a youngish damsel figure  
With her tongue tied to a trigger,  
She seemed a total killer  
Her face all filled with filler,  
Her face a painting palette  
I stomached all her habits,  
Sipped her snow balls poshly like a judge  
But left her lipstick traces on her mug.  
We watched each other closely  
She looks like Bela Lugosi,  
She asked me for a ride home  
I felt around for my comb,  
And in the bar room mirror  
I combed right through her figure,  
She wiggled through the car park  
Into the pit of my heart,  
Sat herself beside me in my van  
A ring on every finger of her hand.  
She lived down by the river  
A flat the council give her,  
Wallpaper very scenic  
Her outlook very beatnik,  
We watched the close and weather  
Then through the door he entered,  
Short sleeves and arms of iron  
And me with just my tie on,  
She said the lodger's used to this by now  
I'd handled all the bull but not the cow.  
Behind her velvet sofa  
I found myself back sober,  
She kept an old acoustic  
She never ever used it,  
A gift for me with a capo  
A six string with an f-hole,  
We made the strangest couple  
A Laurel and Hardy double,  
I learnt to play her favorite country songs  
With one or two chords always going wrong

"
1549,Squeeze,Farfisa Beat,"Everybody's dancing  
To the farfisa beat  
All the girls are crazy  
Acting out the heat  
Tie and shirts and cuff links  
Well that's pretty neat  
  
[Chorus]  
Flash flash mirror ball  
Stereo and disco  
Wow wow ain't she tall  
Moved off my feet  
To the farfisa beat  
  
Pulling my side glances  
To the one across the way  
She wears a lot of makeup  
But they all do these days  
Pretty horny tee shirt  
Well might you explain  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Beat for beat for beat for all  
Cut there in the yea  
Everybody's got their girl  
So is there any spare  
For five foot seven  
Of heavy duty wear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
  
[Chorus]

"
1550,Squeeze,First Thing Wrong,"There's evil in goodness and goodness in bad  
Remember the first kiss, the first kiss you had  
Choked on her tongue and bit on her lip  
She gave her number but that was it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did the first thing wrong, did the first thing wrong  
Oh eyes to the ceiling and pants on the floor,  
I did the first thing wrong  
  
Drove to the city to see the bright lights  
The boys on the corner looked ready to fight  
I stuck my neck out and I looked at his face  
I left her standing, I was caught in a chase  
  
[Chorus]  
But its four in the morning and I knock on the door  
She says ""how you doin ? "" and I say ""I'm not sure""  
I kick the bottles all downstairs  
Guys are freaking out - so what? I don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
Did the first thing wrong  
Did the first thing wrong  
Did the first thing wrong

"
1551,Squeeze,Footprints,"I spent too much money, I looked far too glad  
Now I have so little of what I once had  
I had too many parties I had too much time  
I got so lazy and fell well behind  
Now the summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now  
Footprints in the frost  
The summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
  
We did so much damage deep in our insides  
The party's over it's going home time  
The cathedral is empty, no one's at home  
Winter's approaching paradise postponed  
  
Now the summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost,  
The rain won't stop falling and the people look lost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost.  
  
I rang lots of numbers and walked many miles  
I watched the flinstones and I turned my dial  
To a brand new station where the beat comes in  
Now it's all over the winter begins  
  
The summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
People with umbrellas disappear in the fog  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost

"
1552,Squeeze,Funny How It Goes,"Like trying to knock down pins with marbles in my hand  
She wouldn't take a hi from me the average man  
Funny what money can do to people  
But she had a light that had sparked up her evil  
Trying to chat up women who rate themselves so high  
Shouldn't be my subject but I felt like I should try  
Funny what drink can do for soldiers  
Well she must into men a little bit older  
  
Funny how it goes, how money steals the show  
And all her diamonds twinkle as she dances and what's it got for me  
Hung over in my tree?  
I saw the sun shine bright in front of  
  
Trying to get her dancing was not an easy job  
She made out like Houdini when I said do you bop  
Funny what rhythm does it kills me  
Like champagne women only seem to spill me  
Trying to get the picture, I settled down to a drink  
When up came Cinderella, so what was I to think  
Funny how these shoes fit a dragon  
Well she's like the sharks that you get in Manhattan  
  
Funny how it goes, how money steals the show  
And all her diamonds twinkle as she dances and what's it got for me  
Hung over in my tree?  
I saw the sun shine bright in front of

"
1553,Squeeze,Heartbreaking World,"The saddest thing I've ever seen  
Was a starving face on my TV screen  
The desperate face that I saw  
Had my disbelief hanging from my jaw  
Our harvest could be shared around  
Instead it's buried in the ground  
The saddest thing I've ever seen  
Was a football fan dying for his team  
The toughest thing I have ever known  
Was a soldier boy who never made it home  
It's fiction live before our eyes  
It leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
The greatest thing I've ever seen  
Was a newborn child looking up at me  
The greatest sound I've ever heard  
Was a baby's cry in this wicked world  
The innocence of that cry  
Leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
And you're the one that breaks it for me

"
1554,Squeeze,Heaven,"Bar illuminations shiver  
Shadows on the street  
The Cypriot sailors  
Find the world back at their feet  
Endless days of tobacco nights by the radio  
I wonder if they'll ever go to heaven  
The beer mats are wading  
In a table of froth  
The bar girl is serving  
With a check drying cloth  
She'll bend over backwards even though she's knackered  
I wonder if there'll have her up in heaven  
  
Like the sailors I walk home, it's six a.m.  
Heaven's round the corner in a comfortable bed  
And I love her.  
  
The officers and seamen  
Elbow places at the bar  
Words that tempt the goddess  
Don't leave beats upon the heart  
But she'll service his pleasure  
And never know the treasure  
That his wife keeps forever up in heaven  
  
The first light of the morning  
Proves too much for the street  
No one sees each other  
Just their presence there to meet  
Your chin takes to stubble at the sight of a funnel  
And the gangplank is no trouble up to heaven

"
1555,Squeeze,Heaven Knows,"You're no dame, I'm no duke  
Somehow love is a fluke  
We've survived thick and thin  
Taking knocks on the chin  
In the eyes of the sad  
We may be barking mad  
But the truth has been ceased  
We are like chalk and cheese  
You wind me up and I drive you mad  
It's a fact of life, it goes hand in hand  
And I know that look, it's read like a book  
And I realize  
  
I don't care what the world has to say  
You should know that I love you  
I love you  
I love you today  
  
When the boat starts to rock  
Then my ears start to block  
All the words that you say  
Through the night, through the day  
Where there's muck there is brass  
And the storm soon will pass  
Then it's back to the norm  
All the cold turns to warm  
  
Sometimes I think life crawls like a snail  
And all of our dreams become the wind in your sails  
Without wealth it's true, who cares what you do  
And I realize  
  
I can feel the eyes behind us as we walk  
I can see the ears that listen when we talk

"
1556,Squeeze,Here Comes That Feeling,"Up in the morning  
Politely yawning  
There's frost on the roof of the car  
First cigarette puffs  
Gold links in my cuffs  
Egg on the shirt of my heart  
  
Fingerprints in the dust with my name  
Squint my eyes to see from my fame  
Spot the words that fall from my lines  
The deafness hides the light from the blind  
  
Stop starting journey  
The road returns me  
Back to the world in the evening  
The stage rehearsals  
Voice on the circles  
Blah blah my way to the ceiling  
  
I can't see the walls from the chairs  
Are there people sitting out there  
Feed me with a frown or a laugh  
Featureless the faces that ask  
  
Tonight I'm cracking  
I'm murder acting  
Footlight the visual of my lines  
I'll smoke and drink it  
I'll eat and think it  
Miserable the murder plot unwinds

"
1557,Squeeze,His House Her Home,"I think to myself when we kiss  
Your husband is watching  
From his portrait his eyes are looking down  
On the slipper and stocking  
Back against the bookcase  
Down upon the floor  
Empty the decanter  
Slur again for more  
His house, her home, our future in a lover's world  
Her son, her heart, her love for me, tomorrow's world  
  
I laugh at myself when your son  
Is watching cartoons  
In the morning he's looking up at me  
When we're in the bathroom  
Sees me kissing mother  
Doesn't blink an eye  
Asks a lot of questions  
Answers hard to find.  
  
I talk to myself when I'm drunk  
And she is still sober  
Words are so few and far between  
My arms reach to hold her  
Hungry for the love  
I rescued from the grave  
The past is just a portrait  
The future's ours to frame

"
1558,Squeeze,Hits Of The Year,"Off to the airport to check in the bags  
Proud of my suntan and good times I've had  
Laying on beaches and writing out cards  
Back to the humdrum and bashing out cars  
Into the aircraft I look for my seat  
A nervous tension builds inside me  
Onto the runway I pretend I'm elsewhere  
In minutes we're flying through the hot evening air  
Down there toy town the twinkle of lights  
The long white beaches of holiday time  
Suddenly someone has pulled out a gun  
His shout for attention has everyone stunned  
Hands on our heads there's a new kind of fear  
We're over the barrel with the hits of the year  
  
Held up to ransom assured we'll be safe  
The yellow ribbon comes out again  
How many gods can there be in one sky  
All so important and all so involved  
Here on a trigger a disciple of fear  
As we wait without knowing if we're hits of the year

"
1559,Squeeze,Hope Fell Down,"You're banging your drum  
You blow your own trumpet  
Your ship came in  
And your fanfare sunk it  
The tide has turned  
Our love's gone forever  
I stand on the shore  
As it floats down the river  
  
[Chorus:]  
I had such hopes  
I had such visions planned  
The frames were shot  
But now our future's canned  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down  
  
I'm banging my head  
You watch without malice  
(You watch with no interest at all)  
I bet all your friends  
Compare this to Dallas  
(I might as well talk to a brick wall)  
  
So under the arm  
I feel the cold shoulder  
So I'll once again  
Have to play the wild rover  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do I need all this pressure  
Do I bury my temper  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down

"
1560,Squeeze,Hourglass,"I feel like I'm pounding on a big door  
No one can hear me knocking,  
I feel like I'm falling flat to the floor  
No one can catch me from falling.  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand,  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands.  
The crew have abandoned ship  
The lights are on but now one is in.

I feel like I'm calling on a telephone  
No one can hear the ringing,  
I feel like I'm running up a steep hill  
No one can stop me from running.  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands.

1561,Squeeze,House Of Love,"She was full of lies and boredom  
It came as no surprise that she would cheat  
Her nails were long and sharp  
But she didn't play the harp  
She wasn't an angel I told her  
But she wasn't able to understand my words  
Rich pickings in reverse  
I wasn't Shakespeare  
It's simple  
Did she expect me  
To kiss her feet  
  
A very acidic tongue  
Waggled in her head  
Life was lots of fun  
At times I had to smile  
In front of everyone  
We seemed the best of friends  
Life had just begun  
When on the roof a tile began to slip  
The house of love caved in and that was it  
  
She was full of tears by nature  
It came to me so clear that she would creep  
Her eyes were stale and spun  
Like marbles in the sun  
She wasn't a princess I told her  
And so I witnessed the slaying of my life  
That lasted half the night  
  
I wasn't Jesus  
Believe me  
Our love was seedless  
And incomplete

1562,Squeeze,I Can't Get Up Anymore,"I can't get up anymore, my heart ticks so slow  
There's nothing to do, I'm picking my nose  
I'm counting the days that you have been gone  
My heart went to jail, my love's out of song  
I can't get up anymore, I'm lying in bed  
I'm watching the day through a hole in my head  
I turned myself down, I can hardly be heard  
Now I'm without a heart, now I'm without a girl  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
I can't get up anymore I'm a cold piece of toast  
The doormat is full, the newspapers and post  
There's a letter from you, but I'm growing a beard  
It will never be read, cause I'm going so weird  
Look what women can do I've bolted the door  
Now I'm losing a screw  
All this hunger and trial won't achieve a result  
But a nut cant keep tight without the help of a bolt  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore

1563,Squeeze,I Can't Hold On,"In the corner by the D.J. unit  
The flag of beauty my eyes salute it,  
She likes love  
By luck or labour  
She likes love  
But not for favour - can't hold on  
She keeps her lips on the straw she's sucking  
Looks up to me but her eyes see nothing,  
Love's her stare  
The steps to her heart  
Love's the climb  
The bite not her bark.  
I pour the milk into the cat's saucer  
I'm John Wayne as I'm walking towards her,  
She'd like to dance  
But not this minute  
She's the fish I'd love to fillet.  
I draw first with a stammer of verbal  
We dance like pigeons forever in circle,  
She likes to dance  
Her cocktails shaken  
She likes love  
And it's temptation  
  
The lights flash green  
My envy lights up  
The lights just flash  
And I feel tied up,  
Love's for sale  
And I am sold on  
But there's no way  
That I can hold on  
I can't hold on

1564,Squeeze,I Learnt How To Pray,"She's been good to me  
And her aim is plain,  
With an open mind  
And a tender way.  
As she looks through boxes of secondhand clothes  
She's a first class person as her best friend knows.  
She's been good to me  
Helped me not to lie,  
Listens to my words  
And the truth she finds.  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.  
I learnt how to pray  
Every night,  
To relieve the pain  
Deep inside.  
  
I was serious with a furrowed brow  
I just fell in love what do I do now?  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.  
  
It didn't work for us the lesson I learnt  
The fire was lit and I got burnt.  
And I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.

"
1565,Squeeze,I Think I'm Go Go,"Funny words I cannot read  
Trams and boats where Strauss is street  
Milky way and far out looks  
On your bike and Anne Frank books  
  
Down the disco it's clockworktime  
Where's the humour where am I  
This world's got smaller  
I'm shaking lots of hands  
  
Saying lots of things  
That no one understands  
You can shake my tree  
But you won't get me  
  
Where am I  
I think I'm go go, go go, go go  
  
Liquor store and rodeos  
P I X and rock and roll  
The freckled face the thin and fat  
The drive-in films and drive-in macs  
  
Strip and porno neon signs  
Where's the building where am I  
  
Buckingham Palace trains all late  
Funny little men all out in the rain  
Car front deals and after pubs  
Tenth year plays and seedy clubs  
  
Iffy people don't seem to mind  
Where's the action where am I

"
1566,Squeeze,I Want You,"You took all you could  
And gave all you had  
Knowing that I would have to understand  
As you changed the locks  
And threw out my socks  
There was peace at hand  
You sat in my chair  
Your chin on your knees  
I'm no longer there  
And you look so pleased  
I don't think that I know what to say  
In my heart I love you anyway  
  
I want you today  
How can I score points  
And win back your trust  
Where our two hearts join  
There's a sign of rust  
From the tears you've cried  
With the times I've lied  
To the two of us  
I don't think that I know what to say  
In my heart I want you anyway  
  
I can see the road behind me as I walk  
I can feel the hurt that's burning as I talk  
  
I can see the kids  
As they play outside  
I can read their lips  
Their eyes open wide

1567,Squeeze,I Won't Ever Go Drinking Again (?),"When daylight appears  
Through a crack in the curtain  
I'm laying in bed  
Staring up at the skirting  
I'm alone in my room  
But someone is turning the key in the door  
And I wake up to find  
It's still daylight outside  
There's a taste in my mouth  
Like the thoughts in my mind  
And I wake up to find  
That I left on the light the world can take a jump  
I'm feeling like a lump when daylight appears  
Through a crack in my mind  
I won't ever go drinking again  
When daylight appears  
It's the third time around  
And I swear I won't drink  
Ever again with that crowd  
What on earth did I say  
Did I let the side down I've been guilty before  
And I wake up to see  
The old wonderful me  
All naked and wrinkled  
From knots in the sheets  
And I get up to see  
My hair like a tree  
The world can shut the door  
Because I'm feeling so sore when daylight appears with my eyes full of sleep  
I won't ever go drinking again  
  
Aaaaah how my head's like an anvil  
Aaaaah go the sparks as I angle  
Aaaaah goes the spray from the shower  
How could I smell like a flower  
When I feel like weed in the rain  
I won't ever go drinking again

"
1568,Squeeze,If I Didn't Love You,"If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
Watching you play in the bath  
A soap suds stickle back navy  
A scrubbing brush landing craft  
Your skin gets softer and warmer  
I pat you down with a towel  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
My mind goes out on the prowl  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
  
If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
I'm playing your stereogram  
Singles remind me of kisses  
Albums remind me of plans  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
The wind plays over the coals  
Passionate looks are my fancy  
But you turn the look into stone  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
If I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you, mmm  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
  
If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
Cocoa mugs sit side by side  
It's time to poke at the fire  
But it's not tonight  
Looks I find  
Taking a bite on a biscuit  
The record jumps on a scratch  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
The door of your love's on the latch  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
If I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you, mmm  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I  
Didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't  
Love you, love you, love you, love you

1569,Squeeze,If It's Love,"You've left my ring by the soap,  
Now is that love?  
You cleaned me out you could say broke,  
Now is that love?  
The better better better it gets  
The more these girls forget  
That that is love.  
You won't get dressed you walk about,  
Now is that, is that  
A teasing glance has pushed me out,  
Now is that, is that  
The tougher tougher tougher it gets  
The more my lips frequent  
Now that is love.  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
You've called my bluff I'm not so hot,  
Now is that love  
My assets froze while yours have dropped,  
Now is that, is that  
It's the cupid cupid cupid disguise  
That more or less survived  
Now that is love.  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
You've made my bed the finger points  
Now is that, is that love  
The more you more you more you cool down  
The easier love is found  
Now that is love.

1570,Squeeze,In Quintessence,"He smokes himself into double vision  
Leaves his mind on an indecision,  
Thinks he's invented imagination  
Says that god is some relation.  
He leaves his cigarette burning on the desk  
His clothes and magazines make up such a mess,  
Sitting up in bed transistor on his chest  
In quintessence.  
  
He and his friends sit around all evening  
Leaving their laughter upon the ceiling,  
Seems so funny yet it leaves me yawning  
Then I find it's the following morning.  
He says his girlfriend lives too far away  
Always at a friend's house or on holiday,  
His bible of romance hides itself away  
In quintessence.  
  
A 15 year old's browse through life,  
Is fine with his quintessence safe and sound in mind,  
Life's an adolescence from time to time  
With us all  
In quintessence.  
  
In the corner with his book and tissue  
All he can do is pretend to miss you,  
Closes his eyes as he sees her body  
Pulls funny faces and that's his hobby.  
On the other hand love ain't a happy word  
On the other hand love ain't a piece of skirt,  
Makes for something special in your football shirt  
In quintessence.

"
1571,Squeeze,In The Morning,"In the morning  
It is raining  
And umbrellas block the pavement  
In the cafae  
People waking  
With a cigarette and coffee  
And she sits there with her paper  
Half asleep into a picture  
In the morning  
In the morning  
It's all over  
That's another night of business  
With the punters  
On the corner  
Of estates around the river  
And she adds up all the takings  
Hid behind her wilting paper  
In the morning  
In the morning  
Soaked in bath oil  
Dressed in pink towels  
And a sweater  
Looking out at all the people  
Walking under their umbrellas  
In the morning  
There's a feeling  
Of resentment and expectance  
It's a fear that comes with working  
On the dark streets for a living  
She's attending  
To her wet hair  
At the window in the evening  
Getting ready in a short skirt  
With her stockings around her ankles  
It'?s a flame that gets attention  
In a darkness without light  
And the children need a cuddle  
As she walks into the light  
Of the morning

"
1572,Squeeze,In Today's Room,"Time is a corridor that winds through my life  
Out of each door comes a day  
And when that door closes and I've said good night  
Another door opens again  
Down in the corridor there will be a time  
When I shall run out of doors  
I'll scramble through windows and pull up the blinds  
In another room I'm still not too sure  
That there's no room for me down here  
I shall be sorry  
It will be clear  
And I'll regret not seeing her more  
In today's room love's at the door  
  
I look at my wrist watch, the hands ever turn  
Her face is there I can see  
I'll always regret it but I'll never learn  
Time is so precious to me  
Out in the corridor she sits in a chair  
Here I am pacing the floor  
I've not got the courage, my hand combs my hair  
In today's room I'm still not too sure  
  
That there's no room for me down here  
Will I be sorry  
Well that won't be clear  
And I'll regret not seeing her more  
In today's room love's at the door  
  
In today's room, strawberry jam  
No hope of blue skies holiday plans  
In today's room, trips to the shops  
She's on the doorstep carrying a box

"
1573,Squeeze,Is It Too Late,"I have no reason to lie to her  
I've been a pig  
I'm a coward out of character  
Here's what I did  
I stole money from out of her purse  
Then I got drunk  
And just to make matters worse  
I then fell in love  
Is it too late to unload that gun  
Is it too late to change her mind  
Is it too late to kick me in the teeth  
Is it too late, knock them down my throat  
Hope I choke on them forever this time  
Is it too late, is it too late, is it too late  
  
Now my cards are all on the table  
My fish is cooked  
Now someone else has rocked my cradle  
Funeral's been booked  
I feel so rotten to have done this  
But now it's been done  
And drink was my only accomplice  
And we fell in love  
  
I have no reason to lie again  
Once is enough  
I played my best hand and lost the game  
Losing is tough  
I barked and wagged my tail in the air  
I got off the lead  
I had all the fun of the fair  
That I'll ever need

1575,Squeeze,It's Not Cricket,"She used to do a topless down at the Surrey Docks  
With tassels on her whatsits she did a t'riffic job  
Of raising all the eyebrows of every lunchtime mob  
She went with all the tossers who kick about a ball  
They say their club's the greatest, and she has kissed them all  
At the Arndale Center, she's up against the wall  
I can't name names cause that's not cricket  
I can't name names that would put me in it  
But that's another story in the finish  
I saw them at the pictures a tangled heap of love  
He had so many women, but only classy stuff  
I saw him at the clinic, a pink card up his cuff  
One holiday in Bognor a stag night hit the town  
The groom is in the car park with his trousers down  
But that's another story that won't be going round  
I can't name names cause that's not cricket  
I can't name names that would put me in it  
But that's another story in the finish  
  
The Deptford had a beano to Southend for the night  
With forty crates of lager, to see the Southend lights  
The got home for their breakfast pissed out of their minds  
This girl gave me the minces so I asked her for a dance  
And in the death I kissed her and so I took a chance  
And when I went to touch her, she tried to break my arm  
I can't name names cause that's not cricket  
I can't name names that would put me in it  
But that's another story in the finish

"
1576,Squeeze,It's Over,"Hey wait a minute  
That's not right  
I didn't want this to cause a fight  
All I'm saying is  
Nothing new  
Listen to me, believe it's true  
What's there to hide, it baffles me  
Throw out those thoughts of jealousy  
So don't you cry and hold your head  
It's over  
So wait a minute  
Let me explain  
Out of the blue she called again  
To offer me  
A peaceful meal  
So we can talk see how we feel  
It's nothing more than face to face  
So trust in me I know my place  
I know it's hard to let me go  
It's over  
All over  
  
Have confidence  
Have faith  
There is no attraction there  
And believe me  
This way  
I can wash her from my hair  
  
Hey wait a minute  
What's going on  
I'm coming home where I belong  
It's nothing more than face to face  
Give me the time to pack my case  
I know it's hard to let me go  
It's over  
  
What's there to hide it baffles me  
Why should you waste your energy  
But I won't leave if you're not sure  
It's over  
It's all over

"
1577,Squeeze,It's So Dirty,"Well you'd better not tell I've had a good night  
Me and this bird she's a bit of alright  
Dancing to the sounds as the arches get searched  
She is the business for a bit of old skirt  
It's so dirty when it's in the right mood  
Give it some brandy and some chinese food  
Take her for a spin with your stereo jack  
Tell her she's the best girl you've ever had  
Give it some gold to put round its neck  
Bet here old man puts you on the deck  
But its so dirty with me - it so dirty with me  
Its so dirty with me - its so dirty with me  
  
Well you'd better watch out here comes a tornado  
You'll end up looking like a mashed potato  
If her old man gets word of what's going on here  
You'll end up at the bottom of someone's next beer  
  
Well I've got a bud ain't frightened by shooters  
So lets have a drink for a couple of troopers  
No her old man won't know I've been giving it some  
Unless you tell him the news but we know that ain't done

"
1578,Squeeze,I've Returned,"I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
  
Last night I played the drunken fiddle  
Disabled love with a word of dribble  
On and on about some jumbled subject  
I said your friends were a bunch of muppets  
  
Said your sister should've grown a moustache  
Said you didn't need to take off your mask  
Down the staircase I made my stagger  
I left you cryin' but it didn't matter  
  
And so I sat inside my car in wonder  
A headache in my head like the thunder  
I chewed my nails like a guilty victim  
I couldn't see or feel the night or nothin'  
I wanted to explain, but oh so clever  
Love was like it was some endeavor  
Then I don't remember who said what, when  
On a stack of paper I placed my pen  
  
And when I woke up in the mornin'  
Beside you in the bed  
My mouth was full of nothin'  
My arms around your head  
I don't know how I got there  
But I didn't want to check  
Now back between each other  
We're salvaging our wreck  
Now I've returned  
  
You throw our jigsaw all over the floor  
We're at the deepest deep  
I thought our love had died forever  
But it just went to sleep  
  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned

"
1579,Squeeze,Jolly Comes Home,"She's screaming into his collar  
Beating him on the chest  
He's showing her no emotion  
Their love's put to the test  
He thinks that he makes her happy  
By simply being there  
As the silences get longer  
The more she pulls her hair  
Love can be damaged by silence  
Tied to a ball and chain  
Love can be driven to violence  
From what once seemed so tame  
Wearing his dinner this evening  
Jolly comes home again  
  
The mule's sitting by the fire  
The house at his control  
He hops around the channels  
His eyes on film patrol  
She's driven from her senses  
Her mundane life erupts  
She leaps out of the sofa  
And jumps upon her lump  
  
The room was all dark and quiet  
In bed there side by side  
There in the small of her back  
An olive branch tonight  
He wants to say that he's sorry  
She wants to make him beg  
For all the pain that she's suffered  
In her heart and in her head

"
1580,Squeeze,King George Street,"She left in the middle of the night with the kids  
Wrapped in a blanket with a packet of crisps  
Heading for her mothers on another estate  
The kids looked up at the light and the rain  
In the middle of the night such adventures made  
For two little kids staying up late  
It was rainy and windy as winter was bleak  
At four in the morning on King George Street  
She couldn't get to sleep where on Earth had he gone  
The door opened wide and the light went on  
He was drunk as a lord with a tyre mark hat  
Falling in the hall on top of the cat  
Singing Viva Espana to a crying wife  
He took a swing at the shade on the light  
They were knocking on the doors dressed like refugees  
In the pouring rain on King George Street  
  
She won't have that behaviour in her house any more  
He's got to sober up or get kicked out of the door  
Down on the corner the kids at his feet  
As daddy comes home on King George Street  
  
They stood around the kettle and watched as it brewed  
Sneezing into hankies hands all blue  
The next evening he came around to the house  
With a bunch of flowers they locked him out  
He peered through the window  
Mouthed words through the air  
Her lips to a cup she saw him out there  
The kids came running but were they happy to see  
Their daddy back home on King George Street

"
1581,Squeeze,Last Time Forever,"It all went wrong when I grew jealous  
I didn't realize my strength  
Could take the life of one so precious  
Together we were known as good friends  
  
Did you ever read the words  
That said love would end I read them tonight  
Mistakes I can't defend  
I didn't stop to think  
And I upset her  
I said good night tonight the last time forever  
I think of her tonight  
She keeps me from my sleep but what can I do  
With all of these memories  
I used to be so shy  
And hide my temper  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever  
  
It all went wrong when I grew jealous  
I didn't realize my strength  
Could take the life of one so precious  
Together we were known as good friends  
  
Did you ever read the words  
That say I love you I read them tonight  
But what good can they do  
I regret what I have done  
It wasn't clever  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever

"
1582,Squeeze,Letting Go,"She plaits her hair, I bite my nails  
We balance love on the scales  
I wind the clock and go to bed  
Our love is hanging on a thread  
She gets undressed, I undress too  
The draft is cold in my bedroom  
We cuddle up and say goodnight  
It's all the love there is tonight.  
I can't be brave enough  
She cannot say what we're feeling  
Day after day  
We're going through the motions  
We find it hard to let each other go  
  
She boils the eggs, I make the tea  
Outside the sun shines on the street  
We're at that point here love has gone  
The fuse is lit, it won't be long  
I take a walk, she cleans the house  
This is the end, I'm in no doubt  
But neither one of us can show  
The slightest sign of letting go

"
1583,Squeeze,Love Circles,"The first circle comes around  
You don't want to leave her side  
You're staying in and don't go out  
You're having such a perfect time  
You make your bed and you lie in it  
And time is precious every minute  
The next circle comes around  
And so domestic you become  
In your matching dressing gowns  
You think your life time's just begun  
You cut the cake but just the one slice  
You're crawling back all through the night  
  
Love circles up above  
It waits until your love  
Breaks down and weeps  
Then it's out of your reach  
Love circles up above  
It waits for your love  
Down on the floor  
Then you're there in its claws  
Love circles up above  
  
The last circle comes around  
You're making plans to fill your days  
You're always wanting to stay out late  
And you can feel love start to fade  
You fall asleep or read a book  
The phone goes back upon the hook  
  
When I lay awake at night  
And love can't be found  
The first circle's on my mind  
It goes round and round and round and round

"
1584,Squeeze,Loving You Tonight,"The full moon's glowing  
Blood red in the sky  
It hangs like fire  
On this winter's night  
I sit on feelings  
That hang in suspense  
Nothing in my life makes sense  
A question mark hangs with the stars up above  
As I'm driving home to the one that I love  
Sometimes I can't see the trees for the wood  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight  
The moonlight changes  
From red into white  
It sits on treetops  
Asleep for the night  
I see the signpost  
The road slowly bends  
Nothing in my life makes sense  
A flashing tail light speeds across the sky  
My head's cooking trouble as thoughts seem to fry  
The last temptation was misunderstood  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight  
I'm faced with the ultimate truth  
What if I see that things don't improve  
I know they could  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
The sun is rising  
There's mist all around  
She sleeps beside me  
And I feel so proud  
Am I in heaven  
With her by my side  
This is how love feels tonight  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight

"
1585,Squeeze,Maidstone,"(deciphering the song we have yet to see.  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness  
The chilly winter nights bring the scarves from the drawer  
A crowd starts to gather on paving stone squares  
Teeth start to chatter as the staff leave the store  
And daughters meet mothers and fathers meet sons  
It's too dark to walk home without anyone  
The shopping precinct's closed, it's like a graveyard  
The chain falls through the spokes as I unlock my bike  
I cycle to the pub where I meet with my friends  
And I know that it's love as she pours me my pint  
And strangers meet strangers and friends share their lives  
I look at her again and feel butterflies  
I pull the pillow to my side  
And I imagine it is her  
As I slip into the night,  
I know what I prefer  
But I hope and I pray that one day she will say  
That's it's true  
I can't live without loving you  
Now there's no one around I push the bike home  
The rain's a lovely sound as it runs down the path  
There's our lights in the road, they amber the night  
And there's nobody home, so I soak in the bath  
And bubbles meet bubbles as they become one  
I think about the world and what I have done  
I pull the pillow to my side etc  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness (repeat to fade)

"
1586,Squeeze,Messed Around,"She wants to give up love for good  
She kicks the fence and splits the wood,  
She cries her eyes out in the rain  
She swears aloud and so again,  
She feels messed around.  
She takes her coat off as it pours  
The passing daytime she ignores,  
Sits with a problem on a bench  
And with her heel she digs a trench,  
She feels messed around.  
She rips her skirt and tears her dress  
Climbing over his garden fence,  
Mud on her mourning as tears still fall  
She's in no mood for his love at all,  
She feels messed around  
  
Her door won't shut, her match won't light,  
The bulb went out, her skirts too tight,  
She feels messed around.  
The words don't match, her heart won't heal,  
The phone won't pip, her fruit won't peel,  
She feels messed around.  
  
She left herself open for him all the time  
But always kept off of his cloud,  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Have come to mess her around.

"
1587,Squeeze,Misadventure,"Hitched a hiker  
Up above the border  
She'd spent some time  
In Morocco and Gibraltar  
And stole my wallet  
With a picture of my misses  
With fond remembrance  
Of everything with kisses  
From the Isle of Dogs  
To the Egyptian sands  
Where the Arabs chew on dates  
And I haven't forgot what it's like to be  
With misadventure and her mates  
I miss the East End  
High up on the Khyber  
And I'm the target  
For a dozen rebel snipers  
It's not so bad though  
With some beers in the freezer  
And something fancy  
In the air conditioned sleeper  
In moving carpets  
Through the customs at Dover  
Thinking my journey  
Was going to be over  
Then they discovered  
A shipment of Moroccan  
And said excuse me sir  
There's something you've forgotten

"
1588,Squeeze,Model,"She's ahead of her time and she's never lazy  
But something changed your mind and she could drive you crazy  
Volunteers for winter coats and summer clothes that shine  
Volunteers for magazines I read them all the time  
But that's all right  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do da da da  
Down the runway  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do do  
She's so ugly  
  
Tidy work never suffers when you stage your abuse  
Cocktails in the evening when you're completely nude  
Models at the motor show and I dribble at the thought  
Models looking like lobsters, convertibles and sports

"
1589,Squeeze,Mumbo Jumbo,"Eyebrows plucked and toenails cut,  
I'll pick you up with a little luck, all prim and proper.  
Shaven legs and calls to Fred,  
It all depends o' alright then, I can not stop her.  
The makeup box has always got,  
Ever such a lot of odds and sods, in there to offer.  
She needs paints to make her face,  
And make her late again and again  
So I'll knock her  
The tick is tocker.  
Mumbo jumbo words to say,  
Are you coming out,  
Coming out,  
Coming out to play?  
With a broken nose on a sunny day,  
I would bet,  
I would bet,  
None of these girls would ever care,  
Or get upset.  
Or get upset.  
  
Short and fat with a fishnet hat,  
And a hungry cat in a nice new flat, with her Scrabble.  
Sits by the phone when she's all alone,  
And on her own it's a mental home, full of babble.  
Writes with charm to uncle farm,  
With a broken arm in a broken barn, feeds the cattle.  
She hears the hens as she takes the pen,  
And it's now and now it's then [and now and then a little arab friend],  
She would saddle.  
The dip is dabbled  
  
Kissing curls and boyish girls,  
For all the pearls in all the world, wouldn't have me.  
If I had oil and money to spoil,  
I'd mix with loyal and I get some royal, little lassie.  
I'm up at nine down the line,  
To watch the time 'till half past five.  
I wish they'd sack me  
She's at home the milkman's home  
To have a farm and seeds to sow  
It makes her happy  
The chip is chappie.

"
1590,Squeeze,No Place Like Home,"I'm faced with the facts  
And a fist full of threats  
I stand quite amused  
At the end of the bed  
I have no defense  
For what I have said  
As a handful of love  
Whacks me right round the head  
She's growling and stalking  
And grabs from a pile  
A book that she throws  
And it missed by a mile  
I'm holding a pillow  
And as naked as sin  
I'm backed to a corner  
With a wastepaper bin  
Then up on the mattress  
There's no place to go  
I'm guilty yes guilty  
But there's no place like home  
  
I rewind the hours  
To see what went wrong  
I plead for forgiveness  
And I'm hit like a gong  
It seems that I'm guilty  
Of smiling too long  
When recalling lovers  
That now are long gone  
I'm guilty you're guilty  
So let me be stoned  
The past is the present  
When there's no place like home  
  
Off with the shoes  
And a whack round the head  
Your ear rings like a phone  
Some explanation  
Might patch and mend  
A love that's lost control  
Now there's no place like home

"
1591,Squeeze,Onto The Dance Floor,"Head on my shoulder  
Tears on my shirtsleeve  
What did I say wrong  
Hurt by a gesture  
Not by reaction  
Is love saying so long  
Inside my heart  
Young young young wise people  
Young young young loud sound  
Onto the dance floor  
Out of the sadness  
Tears without tempo  
Swim in their beauty  
Swim in their upset  
The bell will ring  
For me and my girl  
Up to the altar time standing still  
When he says will you you say you will  
  
It's the proposal  
She thought she'd never  
Hear on a dance floor  
Joy finds its features  
Upon her lipstick  
Kissed with an answer  
Inside my heart-  
All up to day break  
All up to dropsake  
I hear a slow song  
Close gets the love ones  
Onto the dance floor  
The bells are ringing  
For me and my girl  
Nothing can alter nothing can change  
I'll go to pieces, pieces of eight

"
1592,Squeeze,Out Of Touch,"You find a hair on my jacket  
And you know it's not mine  
You look at my pillow  
But you're wasting your time  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your smile no longer sings  
I'm so out of touch with you  
Now your phone forever rings  
  
You see a code in my book  
And it doesn't ring a bell  
And this girl I am seeing  
Says she really couldn't tell  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
I have seen another heart  
I was so in love with you  
Love and thanks I can I can't  
  
I won't comb my hair for you anymore  
I won't be in early  
I won't be in late  
I won't be in at all so don't sit in and wait  
  
You hear a howl in the dark  
And you hope that it is me  
But there's no chance  
Now there's no one else to see  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your trap will never be sprung  
I'm so out of touch with you  
So the final verse is sung

"
1593,Squeeze,Peyton Place,"In Peyton Place my heart now beats  
And floor boards creak where an angel sleeps  
Her hair hung across her face  
Like a bush hangs across a wall  
She was short with a tidy smile  
I could hear temptation call  
From a fly in her ointment  
To the big feather in her cap  
It's a small world we discover  
I had once worked for her dad  
I was in gear making up stories  
And we laughed at each other's tales  
I watched her lips I wanted to kiss them  
My train of thought went off the rails  
  
In Peyton Place my heart now beats  
And floor boards creak where an angel sleeps  
In Peyton Place  
I lie awake and hear the sound  
That the angels make  
In Peyton Place  
  
The party was now ending  
So she gave me a lift back home  
Somehow I felt so nervous  
She drove so slowly on the road  
Next thing I knew she was in my arms  
Her hair was all over my face  
I brushed it aside she invited me in  
Now my heart beats in Peyton Place  
  
Her hair hung across her face like  
A bush hangs across a wall

"
1594,Squeeze,Piccadilly,"She's not a picture above somebody's fire  
She sits in a towel with a purple hair dryer,  
She waits to get even with me.  
She hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper  
Explains that she'll be late to a worrying mother,  
She meets me in Piccadilly.  
A begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance  
His song relays worlds of most good intentions,  
A fiver a ten p in his hat for collection.  
  
She talks about office she talks about dresses  
She's seen one she fancies her smile is impressing,  
So maybe I'll treat her someday.  
We queue among strangers and strange conversation  
Love's on the lips of all forms of engagements,  
All queuing to see tonight's play.  
  
A man behind me talks to his young lady  
He's happy that she is expecting his baby,  
His wife won't be pleased but she's not been round lately.  
  
The girl was so dreadful we left in a hurry  
We escaped in the rain for an Indian curry,  
At the candle lit Taj Mahal.  
My lips to a napkin I called for a taxi  
The invite of eyes made it tense but relaxed me,  
My mind took a devious role.  
  
The cab took us home through a night I'd not noticed  
The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez,  
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless.  
  
We crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire  
We kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired,  
Now captured, your love in my arms.  
A door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry  
Mum went to bed without wind of the curry,  
Our secret love made its advance.  
  
Like Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple  
Loose change in my pocket it started to rattle,  
Heart like a gun was just half of the battle.

"
1595,Squeeze,Pinocchio,"Swallow me say swallow me  
Take me to your nest of china dolls  
Call me up your closest friend  
Join me in my neighbourhood patrol  
Happy me say happy me  
Chinese whispers bounce from ear to ear  
The night is young I feel so old  
See the stars above the night's so clear  
I used to come home late and lie, lie, lie  
She used to see through that but still I tried  
I couldn't cover up the tracks I'd made  
That's how it used to be but not today  
  
Race around I race around  
Focused on the here and now with you  
Every smile's a valentine  
What harm can a little loving do  
Fall about then fall about  
Drunk on love I can't stand on my feet  
Before I try please take my hand  
I've so many words left I should eat  
  
Tickle me please tickle me  
Laughter climbs the walls above our bed  
This night we have is built on love  
Help me so I do not lose the thread  
  
Swallow me say swallow me  
Happy me say happy me  
Race around I race around  
Fall about then fall about  
Tickle me say tickle me  
Love me do sing love me do

"
1596,Squeeze,Remember What,"I can't remember what happened last night  
Was there trouble or was there a fight  
I was out with what was her name  
What I did will I ever do again  
And if I did it then what did I do  
Would you let that happen to you  
I'll give this morning back to my bed  
I can't remember I might be dead  
Cupids arrow sliding through the sky  
See you tomorrow come around tonight  
I can't remember what your kiss is like  
I can't remember if you're black or white  
I wish I could, I wish I would remember what  
I can't remember what happened at all  
  
I found my suit all over the hall  
My telephones looking upside down  
Was there paint all over the town  
Is it sunny and is it July  
Does it matter and if so then why  
I'll give this morning back to my cot  
I can't remember if I've been shot  
  
I can't remember which body is mine  
Is it the left or is it the right  
Maybe I had an excess of drink  
What's this mess I find in the sink  
Ashtrays emptied all over my shoes  
Everytime I this booze  
Can't find time for words on the phone  
I'll leave today to play on its own

"
1597,Squeeze,Revue,"You make-believe celebrities  
Taking bows in front of me  
In your dickey-bow ties  
In your dickey-bow ties  
  
Pick your nose beside the stage  
Jesus Christ has come of age  
So you've had a good cry  
So you've had a good cry  
  
Reach out there's people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isn't very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
  
In the dressing room you find  
Telegrams with good luck lines  
So nice to be known  
So nice to be known  
  
The curtain falls so that's the end  
You hit the bottle once again  
So you've had a good crowd  
So you're one of the crowd  
  
Reach out there's people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isn't very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you

"
1598,Squeeze,Rose I Said,"Yes I cried the moment that her hand slapped my face  
A mouth full of sandwich went all over the place  
She left like a tornado the door of course slammed  
I stood in the kitchen a very confused man  
The thump thump of her foot steps went right up the stairs  
The cat ran for cover to the living room chairs  
But what was the problem what on earth could be wrong  
To deserve a slapped face it all seemed far too strong  
  
Rose I said, heaven knows what we've done  
Rose I said, water flows under the bridge  
Rose I said, heaven knows is this love  
Rose I said, curtains close back to read the script  
  
Up to the bedside where she lay in tears  
The drawers were left half open, her clothes laying near  
A suitcase tipped sideways at the end of the room  
I swallowed my sandwich and picked up her boots  
She turned just like an actress, a glare came my way  
I said what's the matter, what have I done today  
She spat out the name of the girl across the road  
I'll never forget the way she flared her nose  
  
Rose was the girl who some days I'd drive to work  
She worked in the office as an articled clerk  
Sometimes we had lunch in the pub along the street  
There was nothing between us, just good company  
I admit that I liked her but that's all it was  
I stood at the bedside in a state of shock  
She heard it different from a friend she met today  
Who says she saw us kissing down an alleyway  
I felt like two people a Jekyll and a Hyde  
I'd really made my bed to lay in this time  
I picked with my tongue at the bread stuck in my teeth  
There through the window, her house on the street  
I knew I was guilty, I told myself to lie  
It seemed to make no differen

"
1599,Squeeze,Sleeping With A Friend,"Hand me a tissue  
Hand me your hand  
I feel like crying please understand  
I have been foolish  
  
I crossed that line  
That borders friendship  
In this bed of mine  
We slept together  
  
And it felt so wrong  
Now I know forever  
That that friendship has gone  
She wore the night shirt  
  
You would have worn  
If you'd been there  
If I had've tried  
To stop myself acting  
  
Like I chose to do  
Is this the end  
Need we pretend  
I slept with a friend  
  
And hurt you  
  
Hand me your pencil  
Hand me your heart  
I feel like writing where do I start  
We drank together and jumped into bed  
  
I had the pleasure  
Then I lost my friend  
We slept together and the guilt's so strong  
Now I know forever  
  
That that friendship has gone

"
1600,Squeeze,Slightly Drunk,"Slightly drunk once again  
All alone with my pen  
I thought I'd write to you  
How can I say how I feel ?  
Falling down on a deal  
This last night with you  
Is it the cold that makes me shake?  
I just hope that I'm awake  
I say alright I knew  
(I knew)  
  
[CHORUS:]  
I was wrong you were right  
(That's a line I cannot find)  
I could not say goodbye  
(to explain just why I lied)  
Why's it always feel the same?  
(slightly drunk what you said to me)  
I'm in love once again  
(can't fall in love without misery)  
  
I'm pretty sad but so what?  
I should be glad but I'm not  
I'm confused once more  
All tangled up in your love  
Without it now so that's tough  
My heart cries for  
  
A little talk to anger me  
Out on the road especially  
Back to you once more  
(once more)  
  
[CHORUS ]  
Slightly drunk once again  
All alone without friends  
Had it all, I know I lied  
All my ends seem untied  
I cannot say how I feel

"
1601,Squeeze,Some Americans,"Some Americans are very pretty  
Some Americans are very shy  
Some Americans are Disney people  
Some Americans eat apple pie  
Some Americans scare me, the leader of the pack  
Living in this theater  
I'm waiting for the trap to drop in the show  
Some Americans gung ho  
  
Some Americans are very happy  
Some Americans will always win  
Some Americans are party people  
Some Americans go out and sing  
  
Some Americans are very lucky  
Some Americans are very poor  
Some Americans are burger people  
Some Americans say no to war

"
1602,Squeeze,Some Fantastic Place,"She gave to me her tenderness  
Her friendship and her love  
I see her face from time to time  
There in the sky above  
We grew up learning as we went  
What a voyage our life could be  
It took us through a wilderness  
Into the calmest sea  
Her smile could lift me from the pain  
I often found within  
She said some things I won't forget  
She made a few bells ring  
So simple her humility  
Her beauty found in grace  
Today she lives another life  
In some fantastic place  
She showed me how to raise a smile  
Out of a bed of gloom  
And in her garden sanctuary  
A life began to bloom  
She visualized a world ahead  
And planned how it would be  
She left behind the strongest love  
That lives eternally  
I have the hope that when it's time  
For me to come her way  
That she'll be there to show me around  
Whenever comes that day  
Her love was life and happiness  
And in her steps I trace  
The way to live a better life  
In some fantastic place, some fantastic place.

"
1603,Squeeze,Tempted,"I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste  
A flannel for my face  
Pyjamas, a hairbrush  
New shoes and a case  
I said to my reflection  
Let's get out of this place  
Past the church and the steeple  
The laundry on the hill  
Billboards and the buildings  
Memories of it still  
Keep calling and calling  
But forget it all  
I know I will  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
What's been going on  
Now that you have gone  
There's no other  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
I'm at the car park, the airport  
The baggage carousel  
The people keep on crowding  
I'm wishing I was well  
I said it's no occasion  
It's no story I could tell  
At my bedside empty pocket  
A foot without a sock  
Your body gets much closer  
I fumble for the clock  
Alarmed by the seduction  
I wish that it would stop  
I bought a novel, some perfume  
A fortune all for you  
But it's not my conscience  
That hates to be untrue  
I asked of my reflection  
Tell me what is there to do

"
1604,Squeeze,The Call,"It felt so bad that I'm in pain  
Then why don't I say no not again  
Your love has failed and all's gone sour  
You have to see her every hour  
When you can't sleep your mind is blank  
But you don't love no longer thinks  
You lose the grip you thought you had  
She smiles at you but you are sad  
So if then heaven sees in you  
Then suddenly its over, through  
You take your life into your hands  
Forgetting all your other plans  
  
And your so sad you cut your wrists  
And they can show you what they missed  
You labor now a point in pain  
But will your worst day ever end  
When you lose or when you've gained  
Don't give up, Don't start again  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take you're life, you're gone for good  
You'll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue you're looking pale  
Love can kill you suck you down  
Suicidal up - side down  
Love's a mystery to us all  
So don't be mistaken what a call  
  
Remember when we used to fight  
And fists would fly throughout the night  
Your face is filled with cherry blood  
And so I feel my time has come  
You tore me from the world I knew  
And suddenly its finished, through  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take you're life, you're gone foor good  
  
You'll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue you're looking pale

1605,Squeeze,The Fortnight Saga,"Business as usual at the harmony home  
Up for the weekend to see my father  
So I'm the one beneath the unturned stone  
I begin the ritual fortnight saga  
Get in the cab, bags packed with clothes  
Cassette player, the jungle of hose  
A pair of shoes for walking in  
Out of the cab, the doorbell rings  
  
Hungover greetings from the man in my life  
A hug, a kiss, and a mug by the fire  
He says I should need a woman I might like  
I drop my bags and walk right by her  
  
Get in the bath, bubbles up high  
Cassette player plays in the night  
She's at the door, wants to come in  
I'm in the bath, I loudly sing  
  
Business as usual at the harmony home  
I can't believe it how time flies  
I'm waving

"
1606,Squeeze,The Very First Dance,"I had finally beat my nerve  
To watch her on the stage  
Removing all her clothes  
Revealing only age  
Some men stared with a stun  
Some sat in married guilt  
That night I chewed a brick  
For ideals I had built  
And there we were in each other's arms  
The very 1st dance that seemed to last  
For ever  
  
Our heads they almost touched  
Our feet beneath us moved  
Professional her dance  
And me the horses hoof  
The lights the beat the vision  
I'd conjured in my head  
Had magically appeared  
And disappeared again  
  
The music stopped we parted  
But only for a bar  
Off to the Bahamas  
Back into her arms  
The excitement of a kiss  
Quenched my lovers thirst  
We walked into the cold night  
A night to remember

"
1607,Squeeze,There At The Top,"She's independent  
She's a modern woman  
She needs no prompting  
On her should 'n' shouldn't  
It's always bosses  
Who wish that she wouldn't  
Files in the cabinet so neatly numerical  
Makes all the clients so neatly alphabetical  
Turn of twenty one  
She's looking at the map  
Looking at her watch  
Bags on the rack  
It seems like she's there at the top  
  
There for her service  
Comfy red Granada  
Up to the midlands  
  
With a taped Sinatra  
Plans all the hotels  
And the airplane charters  
Found under covers with some representative  
The deal is effected but still only tentative  
  
Shorthands a letter  
Heading on the paper  
Slimline her lunch break  
Will it ever make her  
Slender and modern  
So all the men will take her  
Back to the mirror in the empress hotel  
Where the businessman smiles and the object is sell

"
1608,Squeeze,Third Rail,"As much as I love you  
As much as I care  
I just can't pretend that  
The problem's not there  
We know all the boundaries  
From where we both stand  
Our life has been happy  
Without any plan  
But now I feel sorrow  
As friendship turns stale  
Our love's still on track but  
Without a third rail  
The moon has come up now  
The sun has gone down  
A million or more times  
Since you've been around  
Our life still goes on but  
It won't be the same  
As when we're together  
Love only knows pain  
With words that are tender  
Our love will prevail  
But can our love go on  
Without a third rail  
  
White clouds appear like cotton wool  
The wind bends trees to bow  
As we farewell this love of ours  
Like some old sacred cow  
As sure as heaven's above us  
And hell is down below  
Without a third rail to drive us  
We'll have no place to go  
  
There's a lump in my throat  
I'm choked as I say  
Our love has reached twilight  
Let's call it a day  
We kiss on the platform  
The doors slowly close  
Like theatre curtains  
Pulled after the show  
We both know it's over  
And somehow we've failed  
Love's going in circles  
Without a third rail

"
1609,Squeeze,To Be A Dad,"I lost the children  
But they can be found  
Home in a red house just across town  
Sitting in boxes  
Of opened up toys  
Watching The Simpsons  
And making some noise  
I lost the children  
But they're in great hands  
When I cook the dinners  
Right out of tin cans  
I lost the children  
And I have to pay  
Some heavy duty on life everyday  
Cupboards need filling  
With deadlines to meet  
Here in my cheque book  
My fountain pen weeps  
I should be thankful  
And thankful am I  
I went to the cleaners  
And came back with my life  
For a moment it all looked so grim  
It looked like I would not get a thing  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
I lost the children  
They haven't lost me  
We're still together and happy to be  
Out in the summer  
On beaches in parks  
Home in the winter and up with the larks  
I should be thankful  
And thankful am I  
I went to the cleaners  
And came back with my life  
From pushchairs to games of football  
My back was against every wall  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
For a moment it all looked so grim  
It looked like I would not get a thing  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
I lost the children  
They haven't lost me

"
1610,Squeeze,Vanity Fair,"She left her school for the factory  
From pocket money to a salary,  
From a pac-a-mac to a compact case  
And every morning she inspects her face.  
She discovers pulling pints in pubs  
That the good looks will never cover up for  
Her dumbness in taking the stock  
Sees her reflection in a butcher's shop.  
She finds it all quite rare  
That her meat's all vanity fair.  
  
She has her eyes on medallion men  
Who get her home on the dot at ten,  
She combs her hair when she gets excused  
The deal she wants always ends up screwed.  
Paints her nails on the bathroom scales  
Gargles her breath like a landed whale,  
Her beauty is as deep as her skin  
Keeps her eyebrows in a tobacco tin.  
She poses foot on the chair  
Coconut shy but vanity fair.  
  
In her vanity case her compact case  
In her compact case her eyes,  
Not bad for a sister  
But her vanity's fair and her sense of humour's dry.  
She comes home late with another screw loose  
She swears to have had just a pineapple juice,  
Falls asleep fully clothed in her bed  
With her makeup remover by her head.  
And she might not be all there  
But her dream's all vanity fair.

"
1611,Squeeze,Walk A Straight Line,"I need some help  
Help to decide  
Whether it's our love  
That steps out of time  
You say you need  
Time on your own  
Time to accept how  
Our love has grown  
And when you think about  
All of the bad in me  
Think about this too  
How me and you could forever be  
  
In need of help  
Help to expand  
With each others minds  
Together to plan  
Time in our lives  
Time on our own  
So one day we'll see  
Our love has grown  
  
And when that day arrives  
I don't know where we'll be  
But I hope that trust  
Can be for us  
And you'll still love me  
  
I need some help  
Help to be found  
When you are alone  
I won't let you down  
We all need time  
Time on our own  
So we can step back  
And see how love's grown  
  
And when I'm stepping back  
I hope that I will see  
That faith can play a part today  
For both you and me  
  
And if love needs help  
And if love needs time  
Give love the strength  
To walk a straight line

"
1612,Squeeze,Walk Away,"A black and white photograph  
Of me up the garden path  
Wrapped up in my football scarf  
It sits here in my hand  
And there mother smothered me  
And how she would mother me  
She knew how to suffer me  
Like all mothers can  
Now she is everywhere  
The comb that runs through my hair  
My posture on a chair  
But that's not who I am  
He ran from the arguments  
And sat on the garden fence  
And lived in the passing tense  
That fell from her lips  
He tended the house so well  
And each time she rang his bell  
He'd climb back from where he fell  
And gathered his wits  
Now I fear the mold is mine  
A vibration shakes my spine  
As I walk the crooked line  
Reality hits  
  
So let me walk free from you  
You know that you want me to  
Let me try something new  
Let me walk away  
  
If it's not one thing it's your mother  
How I love her  
How I love her  
How I love her  
But it's not so easy to say  
Please won't you let me walk away  
Let me walk away  
Let me walk away  
  
So let me walk on my own  
And finish my ice cream cone  
If we are to make it home  
Then all will be well  
Look see I'm a father now  
I'm raising my own eyebrow  
And being in my own row  
And making life hell  
This is me, see here I am  
Doing the best that I can  
This life has a subtle plan  
But you couldn't tell

"
1613,Squeeze,What The Butler Saw,"Pacing through the flickering light  
A velvet patch upon his eye  
His pacing creaks the floorboards loose  
As he tailors his thoughts for the truth around truths  
But his butler keeps eyes through a hole in the door  
What the butler don't see ain't a lot that's for sure  
Francesca lays across the couch  
They fight with words from mouth to mouth  
And then with handfuls of her flesh  
See how the zipper broke off of her dress  
Strangling her neck with his hands in her gloves  
The port and the brandy mix cocktails of love  
  
The porch light, the torchlight  
The frosted morning lawn  
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn  
On the tale of what the butler saw  
  
He kept his world all to himself  
And locked it tight inside his belt  
But she preferred his belt undone  
She bathed in his fortune but never his fun  
He cracked on a mixture of opera and drink  
The butler still fetches and carries for him  
  
The butler dragged down to the lake  
Francesca's body in a cape  
No private eye was gonna trace this  
The old man was shaking, his marbles were missed  
The shadows and footprints and flickering lights  
The butler's up late with a cold in his eye  
  
The porch light the torchlight the frosted morning lawn  
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn  
On the tale of what the butler saw

"
1614,Squeeze,When The Hangover Strikes,"When the hangover strikes  
And I open my post  
And the coffee is on  
And I'm burning my toast  
  
I let the battle commence  
I see a sun in the trees  
And a draught at the door  
With my head in my lap  
  
There's a day to explore  
But I'm left without sense  
As the hangover strikes  
And I turn on the tap  
  
But the water's too loud  
And I'm caged by the fact  
That the battle's not lost  
Is it the hair of the dog  
  
Or the Baa of a Lamb  
In a sheepish attempt  
To be half of the man  
That I might be or was  
  
When the hangover strikes  
And a mirror reveals  
That it's Midnight or bust  
And a drink does appeal  
  
Now the battle is won  
So the cure of the can  
Pours its heart out on me  
Though I'm feeling locked up  
  
But I can't find the key  
Well no damage was done  
  
Poor poor poor, poor shaken one  
Pour pour pour, pour me another one

"
1615,Squeeze,Who Are You?,"I could smell the rain  
Dripping through the fresh cut grass  
I could spell your name  
On the wet and steamed up glass  
But you were just a name, a face I had conceived  
As being beautiful, very beautiful  
And so hard to believe  
I could catch the drops  
As they fell from on the roof  
I could hardly stop  
Feeling so long in the tooth  
Before I had to guess at what you might be  
And being beautiful, very beautiful  
Is the face I still see  
  
Who are you?  
Imagination painted you  
Who are you?  
With its finest brush  
Who are you?  
Each stroke with tender love  
Who are you, who are you, who are you?  
  
I could see her face  
Magically there she was  
My mouth drew a taste  
So sweet it lingered on  
And there she was by me, walking through the square  
And being beautiful, very beautiful  
At last I found her there

"
1616,Squeeze,Who's That?,"Who's that kissin' in the corner?  
And who's that talkin' on the phone?  
Who's that smilin' like a soldier?  
And why you tellin' me to go?  
  
Who's that drinkin' all the Daniels?  
And who's that sittin' in the rain?  
Who's that readin' all my annuals?  
And why's it sunny once again?  
  
As blind as a bat  
As wise as an owl  
Let go of me, let go of me now  
Who is that, who is that, who is that?  
  
Who's that playin' a sonata?  
And who's that mimicin' my nerves?  
Who's that actin' like Sinatra?  
And why has angel dressed in furs?  
  
So who's that walkin' like the penguin?  
And who's that handin' me a stout?  
Who's that always never ending?  
And no I didn't even come.  
  
So who's that dancin' kind of reggea?  
And who's that askin' for a fight?  
Who's that? Is it necassary  
To kick me out into the night?  
  
Who's that drinkin' all the Daniels?  
And who's that sittin' in the rain?  
Who's that readin' all my annuals?  
And why's it sunny once again?

"
1617,Squeeze,Wicked And Cruel,"I had the rug pulled from under my feet  
But I didn't feel a thing  
I can't believe the luck I seem to have  
And the joy that good luck brings  
When I die Ill return as a housefly  
And land upon her wall  
So I can see who shell end up with  
If its anyone at all  
Did I say that  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel  
I sat and listened to the radio  
A landscape of moving noise  
She was busy looking through the curtains  
Her nose in a distant void  
Then I thought I would come back as a spider  
Because she hates them so much  
They get sprayed down the bathroom plughole  
Can I expect the same touch  
Maybe not then  
Because beneath it all were wicked and cruel  
  
Shut up, listen to the radio  
I can't help feeling I've been stepped on  
She likes to kick like a mule  
Did I say that  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel  
  
If I come back as her would I love me  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel  
  
She likes to think I'm a fool  
Two fools in love  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel

"
1618,Squeeze,Within These Walls Of Without You,"Within these walls of without you  
I feel naked and without a friend  
Love was once there all around you  
Now I feel our relationship end  
I can't put my finger on a reason  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
Within these walls a heart broken  
And memories of a holiday  
The sea leaves my heart so unspoken  
With the lights folding up on the waves  
  
I don't think I'll ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
No unhappy memories are there of you  
When I close my eyes I see  
An image of your love forever true  
But not forever for me  
  
I don't think I'll ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall

"
1619,Squeeze,Without You Here,"I feel so empty  
As the plane takes off  
I see the ground below  
I know that one day  
It won't be long  
That you will also know  
Just how it feels  
To leave you now, a hollow shell  
A broken bow  
I feel so empty high up in the air  
Where heaven's meant to be  
The distance gets me  
When I'm on my own  
Without you here with me  
  
My world is turning  
But it's upside down  
Now you're so far away  
While you are learning  
How this world spins round  
I'm in some other day  
What can i do  
But give my heart  
From far away  
A distant spark  
  
I feel a challenge  
For both you and i  
That's how it has to be  
In life there's balance  
I hope time will fly  
Without you here with me  
  
What i am hoping for  
As life moves on  
And we reach finer years  
We won't be thinking  
Of the time that's gone  
Or wading through our tears  
We'll smile as one  
And speak with pride  
How life has swung  
Back on our side  
  
I feel tomorrow  
Can't come by too soon  
To bring you back to see  
That love will follow  
Like the red balloon  
And you'll come home to me  
I want you here with me

"
1620,Squeeze,Woman's World,"The crown of the kingdom is given to the woman  
The kingdom of the kitchen where she says she shouldn't,  
There on the stainless steel her cigarettes and matches  
Whistles to the radio to every hook she catches,  
  
But the frowns  
Eider downs,  
Tie her down  
But she likes to wear the crown of the kingdom.  
  
She like the recipes a touch of oriental  
Steaming up the windows burning egg on metal,  
Sees in a catalogue a shiny new appliance  
Another role swallowed by the wonders of science,  
  
Lobster hands  
Omelette pans,  
Understand  
How the crown can stick like jam in her kingdom.  
  
He's been so busy and she's been neglected,  
The problem is computed and always it's rejected,  
Out of her heart I catch a spark,  
And being smart  
The crown is left out in the dark now there's no kingdom.  
  
Fed up with the glory she abdicates her title  
Sitting at a bar stool she gives her day's recital,  
The family watch in horror  
As she staggers up the hallway  
Makes herself a sandwich  
As they're looking through the doorway,  
She goes to bed  
Leg by leg,  
Nothing's said  
There's no crown upon her head there's no kingdom.  
  
Press the button on the toaster  
It's a woman's world,  
Tuck the sheets in on the bed  
It's a woman's world,  
Take your apron from your holster  
It's a woman's world,  
Shoot the crown off of your head  
It's a woman's world.

"
1621,Squeeze,Wrong Side Of The Moon,"Across the ocean she's been waiting to hear  
If love's a secret to all the things she fears  
Was it tiptoe around my pillow talk  
They'll come the only boy she had with any thought  
  
The heart pretends I'm not so far away  
She said tomorrow and I'm here today  
  
I miss her now and I say it's only true  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
  
I'm forgettin' to remember to forget  
All the memories locked in my head  
I'll be home then you'll hear what I say  
It seems forever started only yesterday  
My heart keeps time which passes very slow  
When you're lonely without a place to go  
I've got the lonesome ocean blues  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
  
Across the ocean there's a heart that beats for me  
Beat, beating, waiting patiently  
Pulls us together when we're apart  
Keeps the devil from playing with your heart  
But I'll pretend we're not so far away  
I'm home tomorrow or maybe it's today  
Across the ocean there's nothing else to do  
It feels like you're on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon) Wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)Wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)

1622,U2,40,"(Sing this with me, this is 40)  
  
I waited patiently for the Lord  
He inclined and heard my cry  
He lift me up out of the pit  
Out of the mire and clay  
  
I will sing, sing a new song  
I will sing, sing a new song  
  
How long to sing this song?  
How long to sing this song?  
How long...how long...how long...  
How long...to sing this song  
  
He set my feet upon a rock  
And made my footsteps firm  
Many will see  
Many will see and hear  
  
I will sing, sing a new song  
I will sing, sing a new song  
  
(Sing it!)  
  
How long to sing this song?  
How long to sing this song?  
How long...how long...how long...  
How long...to sing this song

1624,U2,A Day Without Me,"Starting a landslide in my ego  
Look from the outside  
To the world I left behind  
  
I'm dreaming  
You're awake  
If I were sleeping  
What's at stake  
A day without me  
  
Whatever the feelings  
I keep feeling  
What are the feelings  
You left behind  
  
Today's a day without me  
  
I started a landslide in my ego  
Look from the outside  
To the world I left behind  
  
In the world I left behind  
Wipe their eyes, and then let go  
To the world I left behind  
Shed a tear, and then let go...

1625,U2,A Man And A Woman,"Little sister don't you worry about a thing today  
Take the heat from the sun  
Little sister  
I know that everything is not ok  
But you're like honey on my tongue  
  
True love never can be rent  
But only true love can keep beauty innocent  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
No I could never take a chance  
'Cause I could never understand  
The mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
You can run from love  
And if it's really love it will find you  
Catch you by the heel  
But you can't be numb for love  
The only pain is to feel nothing at all  
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
And you're the one, there's no-one else  
You make me want to lose myself  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
Brown eyed girl across the street  
On rue Saint Divine  
I thought this is the one for me  
But she was already mine  
You were already mine...  
  
Little sister  
I've been sleeping in the street again  
Like a stray dog  
Little sister  
I've been trying to feel complete again  
But you're gone and so is God  
  
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate  
When the soul wants...the soul waits ...  
  
No I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
For love and sex and faith and fear  
And all the things that keep us here  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

"
1626,U2,A Sort Of Homecoming,"And you know it's time to go  
Through the sleet and driving snow  
Across the fields of mourning  
Light in the distance  
  
And you hunger for the time  
Time to heal, desire, time  
And your earth moves beneath  
Your own dream landscape  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
On borderland we run  
  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Tonight  
A high road  
A high road out from here  
  
The city walls are all come down  
The dust, a smoke screen all around  
See faces ploughed like fields that once  
Gave no resistance  
  
And we live by the side of the road  
On the side of a hill  
As the valley explode  
Dislocated, suffocated  
The land grows weary of its own  
  
Oh, oh, oh on borderland we run  
And still we run  
We run and don't look back  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Tonight  
Tonight  
  
I'll be there tonight I believe  
I'll be there somehow  
I'll be there tonight  
Tonight  
  
The wind will crack in winter time  
This bomb-blast lightning waltz  
No spoken words, just a scream  
  
Tonight we'll build a bridge  
Across the sea and land  
See the sky, the burning rain  
She will die and live again  
Tonight  
  
And your heart beats so slow  
Through the rain and fallen snow  
Across the fields of mourning  
Light's in the distance  
  
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep  
For tonight, at last  
I am coming home  
I am coming home

If you only knew who to hit  
And I'd join the movement  
If there was one I could believe in  
Yeah I'd break bread and wine  
If there was a church I could receive in  
'Cause I need it now  
  
To take the cup  
To fill it up  
To drink it slow

I must be an acrobat  
To talk like this  
And act like that  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
And don't let the bastards grind you down  
  
Oh, it hurts baby  
What are we going to do? Now it's all been said  
No new ideas in the house and every book has been read  
  
And I must be an acrobat  
To talk like this  
And act like that  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
And you can find  
Your own way out  
And you can build  
And I can will  
And you can call  
I can't wait until  
You can stash  
And you can seize  
Responsibilities  
And I can love  
And I can love  
And I know that the tide is turning 'round  
So don't let the bastards grind you down

1628,U2,All Because Of You,"I was born a child of grace  
Nothing else about the place  
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face  
And it left me no illusion  
  
I saw you in the curve of the moon  
In the shadow cast across my room  
You heard me in my tune  
When I just heard confusion  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am...I am  
  
I like the sound of my own voice  
I didn't give anyone else a choice  
An intellectual tortoise  
Racing with your bullet train  
  
Some people get squashed crossing the tracks  
Some people got high rises on their backs  
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks  
You can make me perfect again  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am...I am  
  
I'm alive  
I'm being born  
I just arrived, I'm at the door  
Of the place I started out from  
And I want back inside

All because of you  
I am

You say you'll give me  
A highway with no one on it  
Treasure just to look upon it  
All the riches in the night

Eyes in a moon of blindness  
A river in a time of dryness  
A harbor in the tempest  
  
But all the promises we make  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You say you want  
Your love to work out right  
To last with me through the night

1630,U2,Angel Of Harlem,"It was a cold and wet December day  
When we touched the ground at JFK  
Snow was melting on the ground

Of an angel

Tonight this city belongs to me  
Angel  
  
Soul love...this love won't let me go  
So long...angel of Harlem  
  
Birdland on fifty-three  
The street sounds like a symphony  
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme  
Miles, and she's got to be an angel  
  
Lady Day got diamond eyes  
She sees the truth behind the lies  
Angel  
  
Soul love...this love won't let me go  
So long...angel of Harlem  
Angel of Harlem  
  
She says it's heart...heart and soul...

Blue light on the avenue  
God knows they got to you  
An empty glass, the lady sings  
Eyes swollen like a bee sting  
Blinded you lost your way  
Through the side streets and the alleyway  
Like a star exploding in the night  
Falling to the city in broad daylight  
An angel in Devil's shoes  
Salvation in the blues  
You never looked like an angel  
Yeah yeah...angel of Harlem  
  
Angel...angel of Harlem...

See the canyons broken by cloud  
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out  
See the Bedouin fires at night  
See the oil fields at first light  
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth  
After the flood all the colors came out  
  
It was a beautiful day

1634,U2,Cedars Of Lebanon,"Yesterday I spent asleep  
Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap  
Spent the night trying to make a deadline  
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline  
I have your face in an old Polaroid  
Tidying the childrens clothes and toys  
You smiling back at me I took the photo from the fridge  
Can't remember what Emily did  
Haven't been with a woman, it feels like, for years  
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears  
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose  
The scent of it lingers but then it just goes  
  
Return the call to home  
  
The worst of us are a long drawn-out confession  
The best of us are geniuses of compression  
You say you're not gonna leave the truth alone  
I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home  
Child drinking dirty water from a riverbank  
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank  
Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come  
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon  
  
Return the call to home  
  
I got a head like a lit cigarette  
Unholy clouds reflect in a minaret  
So high above me, higher than everyone  
Where are you in the cedars of Lebanon?  
Choose your enemies carefully, 'cause they will define you  
Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you  
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends  
Gonna last with you longer than your friends

1635,U2,City Of Blinding Lights,"The more you see the less you know  
The less you find out as you grow  
I knew much more then than I do now  
  
Neon heart, day-glow eyes  
The city lit by fireflies  
They're advertising in the skies  
And people like us  
  
And I miss you when you're not around  
I'm getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...in the city of blinding lights  
  
Don't think before you laugh  
Look ugly in a photograph  
Flash bulbs, purple irises the camera can't see  
  
I've seen you walk unafraid  
I've seen you in the clothes you've made  
Can you see the beauty inside of me?  
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?  
  
And I miss you when you're not around  
I'm getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...tonight  
In the city of blinding lights  
  
Time...time....time...won't leave me as I am  
But time won't take the boy out of this man  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
  
The more you know, the less you feel  
Some pray for , others steal  
Blessings not just for the ones who kneel...luckily.

Comes the blackest hole

Why did you offer your soul?  
I was there for you baby  
When you needed my help  
Would you deny for others  
What you demand for yourself?  
  
Cool down mama, cool off  
Cool down mama, cool off  
  
You speak of signs and wonders  
I need something other  
I would believe if I was able  
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table  
  
You were pretty as a picture  
It was all there to see  
Then your face caught up with your psychology  
With a mouth full of teeth  
You ate all your friends  
And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends  
  
You speak of signs and wonders  
But I need something other  
I would believe if I was able  
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table  
  
Where you live should not decide  
Whether you live or whether you die  
Three to a bed  
Sister Ann, she said  
Dignity passes by  
  
And you speak of signs and wonders  
But I need something other  
I would believe if I was able  
I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table

Deeper into white  
Could see the stars shining

Healing hands of love  
Like the stars shiny shiny  
From above  
  
Hand in the pocket  
Finger on the steel  
The pistol weighed heavy

Was beating, beating  
Beating, beating oh my love

Don't believe in the 60's  
The golden age of pop  
You glorify the past  
When the future dries up  
Heard a singer on the radio late last night  
He says he's gonna kick the darkness  
'til it bleeds daylight  
I...I believe in love  
  
I feel like I'm falling  
Like I'm spinning on a wheel  
It always stops beside of me  
With a presence I can feel  
I...I believe in love  
Stop!

"
1646,U2,Grace,"Grace  
She takes the blame  
She covers the shame  
Removes the stain  
It could be her name  
  
Grace  
It's a name for a girl  
It's also a thought that  
Changed the world  
  
And when she walks on the street  
You can hear the strings  
Grace finds goodness  
In everything  
  
Grace  
She's got the walk  
Not on a ramp or on chalk  
She's got the time to talk  
  
She travels outside  
Of karma, karma  
She travels outside  
Of karma  
  
When she goes to work  
You can hear the strings  
Grace finds beauty  
In everything  
  
Grace  
She carries a world on her hips  
No champagne flute for her lips  
No twirls or skips  
Between her fingertips  
  
She carries a pearl  
In perfect condition  
What once was hurt  
What once was friction  
What left a mark  
No longer stings  
  
Because grace makes beauty  
Out of ugly things  
  
Grace finds beauty  
In everything  
  
Grace finds goodness  
In everything

Into the side of love

And the poison rain  
Brings a flood of fear  
Through the ghost-ranch hills  
Death valley waters  
In the towers of steel

Burned by the fire of love  
Burned by the fire of love

Too old to be told, exactly who are you?  
Tonight, tomorrow's too late.  
  
And we love to wear a badge, a uniform  
And we love to fly a flag  
But I won't let others live in hell

And we fight amongst ourselves  
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange  
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song  
Let the bells ring out  
Let the bells ring out  
Is there nothing left?  
Is there, is there nothing?  
Is there nothing left?  
Is honesty what you want?  
  
A generation without name, ripped and torn  
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
Nothing at all  
And if you can't help yourself  
Well take a look around you  
When others need your time  
You say it's time to go... it's your time.  
Angry words won't stop the fight  
Two wrongs won't make it right.  
A new heart is what I need.  
Oh, God make it bleed.  
Is there nothing left?

Blindness  
  
A little death  
Without mourning  
No call  
And no warning  
Baby, a dangerous idea  
That almost makes sense  
  
Love is drowning  
In a deep well  
All the secrets  
And no one to tell  
Take the money  
Honey  
Blindness  
  
Love is blindness  
I don't want to see  
Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my love

There is no limit  
There is no failure here sweetheart  
Just when you quit  
  
I am you and you are mine  
Love makes nonsense of space  
And time, will disappear  
Love and logic keep us clear  
Reason is on our side, love  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
I've had enough of romantic love  
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up  
For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug  
  
God I need your help tonight  
  
Beneath the noise  
Below the din  
I hear your voice  
It's whispering  
In science and in medicine  
""I was a stranger  
You took me in""  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
I've had enough of romantic love  
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up  
For a miracle, miracle drug  
  
Miracle, miracle drug

1665,U2,Moment of Surrender,"I tied myself with wire  
To let the horses run free  
Playing with the fire  
Until the fire played with me  
  
The stone was semi precious  
We were barely conscious  
Two souls too smart to be  
In the realm of certainty  
Even on our wedding day  
  
We set ourselves on fire  
A girl could not deny her  
Its not if I believe in love  
If love believes in me  
Oh believe in me  
  
[Chorus]  
At the moment of surrender  
I'm falling to my knees  
I did not notice the passers by  
And they did not notice me  
  
I've been in every black hole  
At the alter of a Dark star  
My body s now begging  
Though it's begging to get back  
Begging to get back  
To my heart  
To the rhythm of my soul  
To the rhythm of my consciousness  
To the rhythm of yes  
To be released from control  
  
I was punching in the numbers at the ATM machine  
I could see in the reflection  
A face staring back at me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was speeding off the subway  
Through the stations of the cross  
Every eye looking every other way  
Counting down till the pain will stop  
  
[Chorus]

"
1666,U2,Mothers Of The Disappeared,"Midnight, our sons and daughters  
Cut down, taken from us  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
In the wind we hear their laughter  
In the rain we see their tears  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
Night hangs like a prisoner  
Stretched over black and blue  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
In the trees our sons stand naked  
Through the walls our daughters cry  
See their tears in the rainfall

"
1667,U2,One Tree Hill,"We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill  
As the day begs the night for mercy love  
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows  
Only scars carved into stone  
On the face of earth  
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill  
We see the sun go down in your eyes  
  
You run like river, on like a sea  
You run like a river runs to the sea  
  
And in the world a heart of darkness  
A fire zone  
Where poets speak their heart  
Then bleed for it  
Jara sang, his song a weapon  
In the hands of love  
You know his blood still cries  
From the ground  
  
It runs like a river runs to the sea  
It runs like a river to the sea  
  
I don't believe in painted roses  
Or bleeding hearts  
While bullets rape the night of the merciful  
I'll see you again  
When the stars fall from the sky  
And the moon has turned red  
Over One Tree Hill  
  
We run like a river  
Run to the sea  
We run like a river to the sea  
And when it's raining  
Raining hard  
That's when the rain will  
Break my heart  
  
Raining...raining in the heart  
Raining in your heart  
Raining...raining to your heart  
Raining, raining...raining  
Raining to your heart  
Raining...raining in your heart  
Raining in your heart..  
To the sea  
  
Oh great ocean  
Oh great sea  
Run to the ocean  
Run to the sea

1668,U2,Paint It Black,"I see a red door  
And I want to paint it black  
No colors anymore  
I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by  
Dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head  
Until my darkness goes  
I see a line of cars  
And they're all painted black  
With flowers and my love  
Both never to come back  
I people turn their heads  
And quickly look away  
Like a newborn baby  
It just happens everyday  
I look inside myself  
See my heart is black  
I see my red door  
And I wanna paint it black  
Maybe then I'll fade away  
Not have to face the facts  
It's not easy facing up  
When your whole world is black  
No more will my green sea  
Will turn a deeper blue  
I could not foresee  
This thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough  
Into the setting sun  
My love will laugh with me  
Before the morning comes  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as night  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as coal  
...

1669,U2,Party Girl,"I know a girl, a girl called Party  
Party girl  
I know she wants more than a party  
Party girl  
And she won't tell me her name  
Oh no, not me  
  
I know a boy, a boy called Trash  
Trash Can  
I know he does all that he can  
Wham Bam  
And she won't tell me his name  
Oh no, not me  
  
When I was three, I thought the world revolved around me  
I was wrong  
And so I sing along  
And if you dance, then dance with me  
  
I know a girl, a girl called Party  
Party girl  
I know she wants more than a party  
Party girl  
I know a boy, a boy called Trampoline  
You know what I mean  
  
I think I know what he wants  
I think I know what he wants

1670,U2,Peace On Earth,"Heaven on earth  
We need it now  
I'm sick of all of this  
Hanging around  
Sick of sorrow  
Sick of pain  
Sick of hearing again and again  
That there's gonna be  
Peace on earth  
  
Where I grew up  
There weren't many trees  
Where there was we'd tear them down  
And use them on our enemies  
They say that what you mock  
Will surely overtake you  
And you become a monster  
So the monster will not break you  
  
It's already gone too far  
Who said if you go in hard  
You won't get hurt  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
No who's or whys  
No-one cries like a mother cries  
For peace on earth  
She never got to say goodbye  
To see the color in his eyes  
Now he's in the dirt  
That's peace on earth  
  
They're reading names out over the radio  
All the folks the rest of us won't get to know  
Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann and Brenda  
Their lives are bigger, than any big idea  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
  
Jesus this song you wrote  
The words are sticking in my throat  
Peace on earth  
Hear it every Christmas time  
But hope and history won't rhyme  
So what's it worth?  
This peace on earth  
  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth

1671,U2,Running To Stand Still,"And so she woke up  
Woke up from where she was  
Lying still  
Said I gotta do something  
About where we're going  
  
Step on a steam train  
Step out of the driving rain, maybe  
Run from the darkness in the night  
Singing ha, ah la la la de day  
Ah da da da de day  
Ah la la de day  
  
Sweet the sin  
Bitter the taste in my mouth  
I see seven towers  
But I only see one way out  
  
You got to cry without weeping  
Talk without speaking  
Scream without raising your voice  
  
You know I took the poison  
From the poison stream  
Then I floated out of here  
Singing ha la la la de day  
Ha la la la de day  
Ha la la de day  
  
She runs through the streets  
With eyes painted red  
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain  
In through a doorway she brings me  
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea  
She is raging  
She is raging  
And the storm blows up in her eyes  
She will  
  
Suffer the needle chill  
She's running to stand  
  
Still.

Under the cherry tree  
Won't you swing down low

And your precious love

Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh  
It takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh, say bye bye  
Where you going to now  
  
Lightning flashes across the sky  
East to west, do or die  
Like a thief in the night  
See the world by candlelight.  
  
Fall, rise and fall, rise and  
  
In an apartment on Time Square  
You can assemble them anywhere  
Held to ransom, hell to pay  
A revolution everyday  
USSR, GDR, London, New York, Peking  
It's the puppets, It's the puppets  
Who pull the strings  
  
Fall, rise and fall, rise and  
  
Say goodbye, say goodbye  
Say goodbye, say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
  
It takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh  
Push the button and pull the plug  
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh  
  
Fall, rise and fall, rise and

Do they know where the dance comes from  
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb  
They want you to sing along  
Say goodbye, say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye.

"
1674,U2,Shadows And Tall Trees,"Back to the cold restless streets at night  
I talk to myself about tomorrow night  
Walls of white protest  
A gravestone in name  
Who is it now  
It's always the same  
  
Who is it now  
Who calls me inside  
Are the leaves on the trees  
Just living disguise  
I walk sweet rain tragicomedy  
I'll walk home again  
To the street melody  
  
But I know, oh no  
But I know, oh no  
But I know  
  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
  
Life through a window  
Discolored pain  
Mrs. Brown's washing is always the same  
I walk street rain tragicomedy  
I'll walk home again  
To the street melody  
  
But I know, oh no  
But I know, oh no  
But I know  
  
(Out there)  
  
Do you feel in me  
Anything redeeming  
Any worthwhile feeling  
Is love like a tightrope  
Hanging from the ceiling  
  
But I know, oh no  
But I know, oh no  
But I know  
  
Shadows and tall trees

1675,U2,Silver And Gold,"In the shit house a shotgun  
Praying hands hold me down  
Only the hunter was hunted  
In this tin can town  
Tin can town  
  
No stars in the black night  
Looks like the sky fell down  
No sun in the daylight  
Looks like it's chained to the ground  
Chained to the ground  
The warden said  
The exit is sold  
If you want a way out  
Silver and gold  
  
Broken back to the ceiling  
Broken nose to the floor  
I scream at the silence, it's crawling  
It crawls under the door  
There's a rope around my neck  
And there's a trigger in your gun  
Jesus say something  
I am someone, I am someone  
I am someone  
  
Captain and kings  
In the ships hold  
They came to collect  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
  
Seen the coming and going  
Seen them captains and the kings  
See them navy blue uniforms  
See them bright and shiny things  
Bright shiny things  
  
The temperature is rising  
The fever white hot  
Mister, I ain't got nothing  
But it's more than you got  
  
Chains no longer bind me  
Not the shackles at my feet  
Outside are the prisoners  
Inside the free  
Set them free  
Set them free  
  
A prize fighter in a corner is told  
Hit where it hurts  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
  
[spoken part follows:]  
  
Yep, silver and gold... This song was written in a hotel room in New York city
'round about the time a friend or ours, Little Steven, was putting together a
record of artists against apartheid. This is a song written about a man in a
shanty town outside of Johannesburg. A man who's sick of looking down the
barrel of white South Africa. A man who is at the point where he is ready to
take up arms against his oppressor. A man who has lost faith in the
peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man
like bishop Tutu and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa.

Okay Edge, play the blues...

1676,U2,So Cruel,"We crossed the line  
Who pushed who over?  
It doesn't matter to you  
It matters to me  
  
We're cut adrift  
We're still floating  
I'm only hanging on  
To watch you go down  
My love  
  
I disappeared in you  
You disappeared from me  
I gave you everything you ever wanted  
It wasn't what you wanted  
  
The men who love you, you hate the most  
They pass through you like a ghost  
They look for you, but your spirit is in the air  
Baby, you're nowhere  
  
Oh...love...  
You say in love there are no rules  
Oh...love...  
Sweetheart,  
You're so cruel  
  
Desperation is a tender trap  
It gets you every time  
You put your lips to her lips  
To stop the lie  
  
Her skin is pale like God's only dove  
Screams like an angel for your love  
Then she makes you watch her from above  
And you need her like a drug  
  
Oh...love...  
You say in love there are no rules  
Oh...love...  
Sweetheart,  
You're so cruel  
  
She wears my love like a see-through dress  
Her lips say one thing  
Her movements something else  
Oh love, like a screaming flower  
Love...dying every hour...love  
  
You don't know if it's fear or desire  
Danger the drug that takes you higher  
Head in heaven, fingers in the mire  
  
Her heart is racing, you can't keep up  
The night is bleeding like a cut  
Between the horses of love and lust  
We are trampled underfoot  
  
Oh...love... You say in love there are no rules  
Oh...love...  
Sweetheart,  
You're so cruel  
  
Oh...love...  
To stay with you I'd be a fool

1677,U2,Some Days Are Better Than Others,"Some days are dry, some days are leaky  
Some days come clean, other days are sneaky  
Some days take less, but most days take more  
Some slip through your fingers and onto the floor  
  
Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy  
Some days you use more force than is necessary  
Some days just drop in on us  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days it all adds up  
And what you got is not enough  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are slippy, other days sloppy  
Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy  
Your skin is white but you think you're a brother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you wake up with her complaining  
Some sunny days you wish it was raining  
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin  
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are honest, some days are not  
Some days you're thankful for what you've got  
Some days you wake up in the army  
And some days it's the enemy  
  
Some days are work, most days you're lazy  
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby  
Lookin' for Jesus and His mother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you feel ahead  
You're making sense of what she said  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight

You know I don't see you when she walks in the room  
  
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help  
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else  
They say a secret is something you tell one other person  
So I'm telling you, child  
  
A man will beg  
A man will crawl  
On the sheer face of love  
Like a fly on a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest  
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success  
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief  
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief  
  
Over love...  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
Love...we shine like a  
Burning star  
We're falling from the sky  
Tonight  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall

Out of the living world  
Out of time

Life and an answer  
The key to an open door

Living I'm limping more  
  
It's out of mind

And the ground beneath her feet  
  
And now I can't be sure of anything  
Black is white, and cold is heat  
For what I worshiped, stole my love away  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
  
Go lightly down your darkened way  
Go lightly underground  
I'll be down there in another day  
I won't rest until you're found

Let me bring you to where two roads meet

1683,Ultravox,A Friend I Call Desire,"Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
  
You live for love, I long for it  
You give for love, I take from it  
This friend of mine, desire  
This lover's crime, desire  
Emotion driving all the time  
A burning need for things not mine  
  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
  
You reach for love, I walk from it  
You fight for love, I run from it  
My enemy, desire  
Caressing me, desire  
The torch I carried burnt my hand  
I can't control what I can't stand  
  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
  
You live for love, I lie for it  
You give for love, I shy from it  
  
And the pain, and the lust  
And the want, and the hurt  
And the lies, and the fear  
And the urge, and the feel  
And the touch, and it's all  
  
A friend I call desire  
  
You live for love, I lie for it  
You live for love, I die for it  
  
And the pain, and the lies  
And the touch, and it's all

1684,Ultravox,All Fall Down,"When I was boy  
There's a dream that I had  
That a war if was fought  
Was for good against bad  
And I woke up to find  
That the world had gone mad  
  
And we'd all fall down  
  
And I feel like a child again  
Sitting or turning  
You're toying with power  
Your fingers are burning  
You're pushing so hard  
That the worlds won't be turning  
  
We'll all fall down  
  
When you try to pretend  
That you're a god upon high  
With your party ideals  
And your squeaky clean lies  
When it comes to the crunch  
You're no smarter than I  
  
And we'll all fall down  
  
If it's colour of creed or all time religion  
Well fighting for that shows  
A pure lack of vision  
The fight that we strive  
Is a fight to survive  
  
And we'll all fall down  
  
Well look in the mirror  
And what do you see  
An American, Russian  
A soldier or me  
When you all press the buttons  
Just where will you be?  
  
When we all fall down

"
1685,Ultravox,Artificial Life,"All the boys are wearing their utility drag  
The girls slip identikits from their utility bags  
Some refugees from suburbia are laughing  
Examining each other's gags  
Vibrate on sulphate when it gets late  
And their velocity begins to sag  
Chorus:  
And it goes on all night, all night  
And it goes on and on, the artificial life  
Mary Mary got so confused  
About the fusion game, what a game  
Blunked on booze, she talks like a newsreel  
She'll take up any kind of bleak exchange  
She turned to perfection once  
But realized she'd only turned to pain  
She ran through divine light, chemicals, Warhol, scientology, her own sex  
Before she turned away  
(Chorus)  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
Stranger still  
I should have left here years ago  
But my imagination won't tell me how  
This whirlpool's got such seductive furniture  
It's so pleasant getting drowned  
So we drink and sink and talk and stalk  
With interchangeable enemies and friends  
Trying on each other's skins  
While we're dying to be born again.  
(Chorus)

"
1686,Ultravox,Blue Light,"Thought I'd take the slide  
I thought I'd be alright  
But when the details swam  
Oh no, the door got jammed  
Someone took the hand  
And we were out slow dancing  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
There was a crowd below  
Swanning in the glow  
All the paste it shimmered  
In the swimmer's glimmer  
It was a sticky summer  
And I was diving under...  
The Blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
Well nothing drove out behind me  
I was so glad  
Even the walls were turning round  
Well, someone said  
There was something wrong  
But I couldn't quite  
Put my finger on it  
What the...  
Well I thought I heard...  
And I tried to...  
Then we were just diving  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  

"
1687,Ultravox,Can't Stay Long,"I can feel the turning of the tides  
Pulling away the night  
Like a sheet from over me  
In summer time  
I dissolve to a beach  
And everywhere seems to be  
Just a flicker on a silent screen  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
Let the sky roll on  
Just a flicker and the crowd moves on  
In winter  
Overcoats close in  
And the snow tastes of tin  
On the steps of any station  
I'd like to glide in the long green light  
Of a July afternoon  
Sliding down a vague conversation  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
When the moment comes  
Just a glance and the glance is gone  
Watch closely  
As a man with a hat  
And a girl with a map  
Synchronise with the track  
And they go away  
I need to drift through all the walls  
And let the scenery dissolve  
Into some other life  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
Let the sky roll on  
Just a glance and the glance is gone  
I  
I can't stay long  
When the right time comes  
I'll dissolve  

"
1688,Ultravox,Cut And Run,"[Chorus:]  
See the man on the 'phone,  
With a gun in his hand,  
Sipping courage from a crystal cup.  
He's a man in the wrong,  
With a gun at his head,  
Pushes on and now it's time to cut and run.  
Time, passing so slowly.  
Still, as he sits and he watches the sand slip through his hands.  
He demands something more,  
Something strong,  
Something savage and pure.  
One more twist of the knife and it's time to cut and run.  
(Chorus)  
He smiles, as he draws on his last cigarette,  
And he tries to forget all that forces every move.  
He commands something new,  
Something strong,  
Something spiteful and true.  
One more twist of the knife and it's time to cut and run.  
Cries on his tape so they might understand.  
Signs his farewell with a squeeze of his hand.  
(Chorus - Repeat 4 times and fade)

"
1689,Ultravox,Dangerous Rhythm,"[Chorus]  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm in the air  
  
Stranger to stranger  
We're both dressed for danger  
Something is generating here  
  
Oh, take off your halo  
For the all-night inferno  
Something is happening in the air  
  
It's not like anything I've ever known before  
And I don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Surging and merging  
Urgent and urging  
Soft as a footstep on the stair  
  
The red light is on now  
My gravity's gone and how  
I can feel something in the air  
  
It's not like anything I've ever known before  
And I don't care  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"
1690,Ultravox,Dislocation,"Running down an empty street  
Perhaps it was a railway station  
Smell of ??? cologne  
The sound of a celebration  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh-oh-oh dislocation  
Oh-oh-oh dislocation  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The sun was going down one quiet evening  
Someone came into the room while I was half-asleep  
We spoke for a while, I couldn't see his face  
Later on when he was gone, I realized I didn't catch his name  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x3]  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under

"
1691,Ultravox,Fear In The Western World,"Your picture of yourself is a media myth  
Underneath this floor we're on the edge of a cliff  
Someone told me Jesus was the Devil's lover  
While we masturbated on a magazine cover  
[Chorus:]  
Dead in the streets  
Who's that girl?  
Ireland screams  
Africa burns  
Suburbia stumbles  
The tides are turned  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western  
The Western world  
Mama's still on valium, Daddy puts the news on  
TV orphans laugh at the confusion  
The audience finds itself on the stage  
Fifty million people in a state of decay  
(Chorus)  
The party goes on behind elevator doors  
While the elevator plummets from the 69th floor  
All the cars lost in the scrapyards of paradise  
The newspaper photographs have all come alive  
(Chorus)  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western  
The Western world

"
1692,Ultravox,Frozen Ones,"Marching across our own screens  
Our faces form all our needs  
The future's not returning  
All bridges built for burning  
How can there be anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
One day I'll just erase the tape, wave goodbye, and fade away  
Get lost in the frost again  
Clean the ashes of my face at the bottom of your suitcase  
Find a sunset, turn away  
How can there by anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
We walk around inside each other visiting the empty rooms  
Put me on, I'll put you on too  
You knew I'd have to follow you because you saw I'm hollow too  
But it's so nice being I too  
How can there by anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Chorus:  
We're nowhere  
We don't care who led us here  
No-one will care when we're gone  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Too many pictures on my screen and all of them are screaming at me  
Thought I had this insulation  
The only way to stop the flood whenever feelings get too real  
Is to cut the information  
How can there be anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
(Chorus)  
The frozen ones  
(Repeat and fade)

"
1693,Ultravox,Heart Of The Country,"I was young and not deceived then  
I believed in the heart of the country  
How the words sound, how the truth lies  
I was moved by the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, then I saw through  
The charade, the facade,  
Now I've had it all  
When they ask you who deprives you  
You reply your heart of the country  
I am older, I am wiser  
I despise the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, then I felt it  
All the tears and the grief  
I believed it all  
Taking bad times, by the handful  
Do what you can for the heart of the country  
They dish the dirt out too hard to swallow  
Just to follow the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, heed the words  
And learn the lines  
I'll be fine when I have it all  

"
1694,Ultravox,I Am Alive,"I, I'm moving through time  
Being human by design  
Life  
Unfulfilled but divine  
Never ending  
How could I be so blind?  
What is this world  
Doing to me?  
Notwithstanding the lies  
All the tears I have cried  
I've opened my eyes  
  
(Chorus:)  
I am alive  
I am who I want to be  
Walls are falling  
I am alive  
And this is my destiny  
The king is calling  
I am alive  
Far from the maddening crowd  
Playing mind games  
Way out loud  
Pictures of heroes  
Lined up one by one  
Embracing the future  
I have begin  
  
(Chorus)  
Passing strangers  
Artificial life  
Slowly falling  
Look out for me  
I am alive

"
1695,Ultravox,I Remember (Death In The Afternoon),"We turned the dial, we heard the news and laughed, we don't know why  
We drank the wine and spoke of times we knew of days gone by  
We flicked through photographs we had, somehow they made us sad  
Remembering the times we used to have, it made us cry  
  
Oh I remember death in the afternoon  
  
A silence fell about the room with harsh and heavy calm  
The lovers and the friends all felt the same, it kept us warm  
We raised our glass and drank to times we had, but'd see no more  
The pictures of the past would haunt us still, and there remains  
  
Oh I remember death in the afternoon

"
1696,Ultravox,I Want To Be A Machine,"I found the bones of all your ghosts  
Locked in the wishing well  
While bird song gourmets dragged empty nets  
I slumbered in my shell  
In mitternacht, die mensch-maschine  
Kissed me on my eyes  
I rose and left the fire-ladies  
Glowing lonely in the night  
With all the pornographers  
Burning torches beneath the sea  
  
[Chorus:]  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
  
I stole a cathode face from newscasts  
And a crumbling fugue of songs  
From the reservoir of video souls  
In the lakes beneath my tongue  
In flesh of ash and silent movies  
I walked at boulevards again  
A nebula of unfinished creatures  
From the lifetimes of my friends  
I hope your innocence has depraved me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Broadcast me, scrambled clean  
Or free me from this flesh  
Let the armchair cannibals take their fill  
In every cell across wilderness  
We'll trip such a strangled tango  
We'll waltz a wonderland affair  
Let's run to meet the tide tomorrow  
Leave all emotion dying there  
In the star cold beyond all of your dreams  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ah!

"
1697,Ultravox,Man Who Dies Every Day,"Someone stood beside me for a moments in the rain  
A silhouette, a cigarette and a gesture of disdain  
I felt a dark door open, saw a sudden ghost come through  
A spark leap from my fingertip and I knew it must be you  
Ain't you the man who dies every day?  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
We never saw you walk in, we never saw you leave  
You flick the ashes off a lap on everybody's sleeve  
You always play that funny pack of cards without an ace  
And every street you ever walked is mapped out on your face  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
You always kept a sunset behind your lonely shoulder  
You never showed on photographs and you never grew much older  
You flicker like a shaky shadow, moving like a thief  
You never drop your facade and you never seek relief  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man

1698,Ultravox,Maximum Acceleration,"I thought you knew me by now  
Let the lights go on roaring  
Someone's hand on my shoulder  
Then whip past the turning point  
There's time for the taking  
  
[Chorus]  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
  
A face that goes slowly  
A signal close by me  
The landscapes are changing  
And some of us flipped a coin  
And shimmered away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You really were aching  
It's turning to twilight  
Moving over and under  
Then a couple of figures  
Shook their heads of the high lines  
  
[Chorus]

"
1699,Ultravox,Passing Strangers,"We were so young, we were too vain.  
Dance in the dark, sing in the rain.  
Time on our hands, hope in our hearts.  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon.  
  
We stood alone, silent and proud.  
Moments unknown, lost in a crowd.  
Running through memories like thieves in the night.  
Clutching emotions, holding too tight.  
Hold turns to dust, shattered by light.  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon

1700,Ultravox,Saturday Night In The City Of The Dead,"While a fat guy zips by, bony in a Zodiac  
Picking out trouble, maybe looking for a heart attack  
All-night boys in the Piccadilly arcade  
(???) trawling for some rough trade  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Can't you feel the time bomb ticking in your head?  
Too many memories are burning in your bed  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Dead in the dole queue, face like a statue  
Laugh like a maniac, walk like a king too  
Spiked hair, don't care, hot spam outlaw  
Rad man (?) rips it out, you're buzzing like a chainsaw  
(Chorus)  
High-rise reptile sucking on a cigarette  
Ripped suit, zip boots, dancing like an insect  
Tottenham Court Rolexes the excuses (?) in the wind hide  
The city's pretty dead but I'm still alive

Saturday night  
Saturday night

Saturday night in the city of the dead

1701,Ultravox,The Closer I Get To You,"My obsession  
Your desire  
Come let me lead you  
To the fire  
Show some mercy  
My pounding heart  
Can't take much more of this  
You've got play your part  
Bodies yearning  
Is this for real?  
Words cannot express the way I really feel  
Passion burning  
You ignite the flame  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll never be the same again  
Chorus:  
The closer I get to you  
The more I reveal is true  
And something inside of me  
Burns my reality  
Use your imagination  
Exorcise  
See your future  
Through my eyes  
No salvation  
Nowhere to hide  
We're one dimension  
We're one inside  
Is this perfection  
Taken to extreme?  
We're drowning in a sea of possibilities  
Pure emotion  
You can't conceal  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll know that this time it's for real

Bodies yearning  
Is this for real?  
Words cannot express the way I really feel

You ignite the flame

We'll never be the same again

Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
  
I'm a lonely hunter, a hungry ghost  
When you call a passion you must pay the host  
Look upon me as I thunder, I wonder if you wonder  
How it feels to be the lonely hunter  
  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
The wind blows clouds across my cheek  
My collar's up and my coat is sleek  
  
Look upon me as I blunder, I wonder if you wonder  
How it feels to be the lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter

Welcome to the song.  
And when it calls you, time to move on.  
We go!

Feel the strength of a hundred thousand heartbeats,  
Cry welcome to the song.

Drawn from the inside,  
Time to move on.  
We go!

1704,Ultravox,(The) Thin Wall,"The sound is on the visions move  
The image dance starts once again  
They shuffle with a bovine grace and glide in syncopation  
Just living lines from books we've read  
With atmospheres of days gone by  
With paper smiles  
The screenplay calls a message for the nation  
Chorus:  
And those who sneer will fade and die  
And those who laugh will surely fall  
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall  
The thin wall  
Thin wall  
Grey men who speak of victory  
Shed light upon their stolen life  
They drive by night and act as if they're moved by unheard music  
To step in time and play the part  
With velvet voices smooth and cold  
Their power games a game no more  
And long the chance to use it  
(Chorus)  
And those who dance will spin and turn  
And those who wait will wait no more  
And those talk will hear the word  
And those who sneer will fade and die  
And those who laugh will surely fall  
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall  
The thin wall  
Thin wall  
The thin wall (Repeat 3 times)  
And those who dance  
The thin wall  
And those who talk  
The thin wall  
And those who sneer  
The thin wall  
And those who laugh  
The thin wall  
And those who know

And those who dance

And those who wait  
The thin wall  
And those who talk

1705,Ultravox,Vienna,"Walked in the cold air  
Freezing breath on a window pane  
Lying and waiting  
A man in the dark in a picture frame  
So mystic and soulful  
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry  
It stays with you until  
  
The feeling has gone only you and I  
It means nothing to me  
This means nothing to me  
Oh, Vienna  
  
The music is weaving  
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings  
The rhythm is calling  
Alone in the night as the daylight brings  
A cool empty silence  
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky  
It fades to the distance  
  
The image has gone only you and I  
It means nothing to me  
This means nothing to me  
Oh, Vienna  
  
This means nothing to me  
This means nothing to me  
Oh, Vienna

1706,Wham!,A Different Corner,"I'd say love was a magical thing  
I'd say love would keep us from pain  
Had I been there, had I been there  
  
I would promise you all of my life  
But to lose you would cut like a knife  
So I don't dare, no I don't dare  
  
'Cause I've never come close in all of these years  
You are the only one to stop my tears  
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared  
  
Take me back in time maybe I can forget  
Turn a different corner and we never would have met  
Would you care  
  
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze  
Little by little you've brought me to my knees  
Don't you care  
  
No I've never come close in all of these years  
You are the only one to stop my tears  
I'm so scared of this love  
  
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used  
I should go back to being lonely and confused  
If I could, I would, I swear

1707,Wham!,Bad Boys,"Woo-woo  
Dear mummy, dear daddy,  
You had plans for me, I was your only son.  
And long before this baby boy could count to three,  
  
You knew just what he would become.  
  
Run along to school,  
No child of mine grows up a fool,  
Run along to school.  
  
When you tried to tell me what to do,  
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you,  
One thing that I know for sure

Stick together, never sad boys  
Good guys  
They made rules for fools, so get wise  
  
Dear Mummy, Dear Daddy,  
Now I'm nineteen as you see,  
I'm handsome, tall, and strong.  
So what the hell gives you the right to look at me,  
As if to say ""Hell, what went wrong?""  
  
Where were you last night?  
You look as if you had a fight.  
Where were you last night?  
  
Well I think that you may just be right,  
But don't try to keep me in tonight,  
Because I'm big enough to break down the door.  
  
Bad boys  
Stick together, never Sad Boys  
Good guys  
They made rules for fools, so get wise  
  
Boys like you, are bad through and through.  
Still,  
Girls like me, always seem to be with you  
  
We can't help but worry,  
You're in such a hurry,  
Mixing with the wrong boys,  
Playing with the wrong toys.  
Easy girls,  
And late nights,  
Cigarettes, and love bites  
Why do you have to be so cruel?  
You're such a fool  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"
1708,Wham!,Battlestations,"You ask too much of me  
You try my patience  
Your tongue, it's like a razor  
You choose your words like weapons  
Here we go, Battlestations  
  
I never have the guts to let you look inside  
I don't think you'd appreciate the things that I hide  
  
[Chorus]  
Monday was the worst day  
And Friday wasn't my day  
But Wednesday was the best day  
Because on Wednesday night we made love  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(Than we ever do in bed)  
  
You don't know how much I hate that answer phone  
Are you standing there?  
But, you won't pick up the 'phone  
Why lie to my face?  
(When you can buy a tape machine to give me bullshit in your place)  
  
Today I did something I thought I'd never do  
I opened up your diary and read about you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Monday was the worst day  
Wednesday we made love  
And Friday, ooh but,  
Saturday, is today, is what I'm thinking of  
Come in baby, come in close  
(Take off your designer clothes)  
'cause you know what I'm thinking of  
Do you remember me, do you remember us,  
Do you remember love?  
  
All I'm trying to give you is a good time honey  
Why d'ya have to keep on playing games with my head  
Used to be your baby when you had no money  
Now we spend more time in battle  
Than we ever do in bed  
(Than we ever do in bed)  
  
La premiere fois tu m'as fait beaucoup rire  
Tu etais si mignon, et tu jouais do piano  
Maintenant, mon mellieur ami see'est l'argent  
Au revoir, cheri  
Au revoir, mon amour

"
1709,Wham!,Blue,"Every day it seems my smile's a little harder  
And every day, I seem to laugh a little less  
Living this way, it seems my sky's a little darker  
You went away and left me lonely in success  
  
(Can't you see I'm falling apart) (Repeat)  
Can't you see what's happenin' to me  
  
Take this hand and show my fingers where my heart is  
Understand, you may just save me from despair  
Watch this man, you'll see he can't stop what he has started  
Take this hand, you'll see right now there's no-one there  
  
(Can't you see I'm falling apart)  
You laugh at me as I fall  
(Can't you see I'm falling apart)  
Just tell me, tell me, give me one good reason  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But instead I watch you die  
  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
But on my own I just can't make it  
I'm too weak to fight, so take it  
Armed with love, I could save my heart  
Tell me why am I so blue.

"
1710,Wham!,Careless Whisper,"I feel so unsure  
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor  
As the music dies, something in your eyes  
Calls to mind the silver screen  
And all its sad good-byes  
  
I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
Should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Time can never mend  
The careless whispers of a good friend  
To the heart and mind  
Ignorance is kind  
There's no comfort in the truth  
Pain is all you'll find  
  
I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
I should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
Never without your love  
  
Tonight the music seems so loud  
I wish that we could lose this crowd  
Maybe it's better this way  
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say  
  
We could have been so good together  
We could have lived this dance forever  
But no one's gonna dance with me  
Please stay  
  
And I'm never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have got no rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know your not a fool  
  
Should've known better than to cheat a friend  
And waste the chance that I've been given  
So I'm never gonna dance again  
The way I danced with you  
  
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone  
(Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong, so wrong  
That you had to leave me alone

1711,Wham!,Club Tropicana,"Let me take you to the place  
Where membership's a smiling face,  
Brush shoulders with the stars.  
Where strangers take you by the hand,  
And welcome you to wonderland  
From beneath their panamas  
  
[Chorus]  
Club Tropicana, drinks are free,  
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone.  
All that's missing is the sea,  
But don't worry, you can suntan!  
  
Castaways and Lovers meet,  
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat,  
Watch the waves break on the bay.  
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon,  
Cocktail time, a summer's tune,  
A whole night's holiday!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pack your bags,  
And leave tonight.  
Don't take your time,  
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight!  
Cool, cool, cool, cool

Cool, cool, cool, cool

1712,Wham!,Come On!,"[Chorus]  
Come on, everybody!  
Get on, with your party!  
And don't let nobody say you're wrong.  
O.k.  
So you've lost control,  
But they'll never steal your soul  
No way!  
That they're gonna spoil your fun.  
  
Greedy men, in far off places,  
Don't be afraid to show your faces.  
We know what you've done is wrong,  
But clap your hands, and sing along now!  
Don't even bother, to let us know,  
When you flick the switch and stop the show,  
Because the party has begun,  
And we'll still be dancing, as-you-run-now!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, don't think that I'm not scared,  
Oh no, don't think that I'm prepared.  
I just take each day as it comes,  
Because it may, it may,,  
It may be the last one!  
I know they don't care about me,  
I ain't got no money, ain't a v.i.p.  
And I know they don't care about you,  
You may, as well, enjoy your life like I do!

"
1713,Wham!,Credit Card Baby,"You said that you loved me,  
And I thought that it was true.  
You said that you needed me,  
And baby I believed that too.  
  
I thought that you were shy,  
But you put me straight with a wink of your eye.  
I should've known better,  
Put my hands in my pockets every time I see you cry.  
  
People think you're just so sweet,  
But they don't know you quite like I do.  
I guess they think that I'm a lucky guy,  
But you're not fooling everybody.  
  
[Chorus]  
You can have my credit card baby,  
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady.  
All I know is what I see,  
You're getting what you want and girl it ain't just me.  
No matter how you cry,  
I'm not giving any love away...  
Do you think I'm crazy?  
All I know is what I see,  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me baby?  
  
Don't say that you love me,  
Because I know that it's not true.  
Just tell me you need my money,  
Girl you know I'll give it to you.  
  
Between the ocean and the sky  
There are things that you can't buy.  
And if you look you'll see  
One of them is me.  
Take you hands out of my pockets  
Digging till the day you die.  
  
People think you're just so sweet,  
But they don't know you quite like I do.  
I guess they think that I'm a lucky guy,  
But you're not fooling anybody.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These are the things that you've made for yourself,  
You've gotta take your opportunities or stay on the shelf.  
You've gotta stay  
Oh yeah,  
Well, that's OK  
It's just a game that we play.  
  
No matter how you cry,  
I'm not giving any love away.  
Do you think I'm crazy?  
All I know is what I see,  
And what can I do  
When you pretend that you're in love with me baby?

"
1714,Wham!,Freedom,"Everyday I hear a different story,  
People saying that you're no good for me,  
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""  
  
If you loved me baby you'd deny it,  
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,  
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand  
  
But you know that I'll forgive you,  
Just this once, twice, forever,  
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,  
Just as long as we're together.  
And you do  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want your freedom,  
I don't want to play around,  
I don't want nobody baby,  
Part time love just brings me down.  
I don't want your freedom,  
Girl, all I want right now is you.  
  
Like a prisoner who has his own key  
But I can't escape until you love me  
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys  
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do  
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you  
But you know that I'll forgive you  
Just this once twice forever  
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back  
Just as long as we're together  
And you do

Come on baby, (ooh, take me home  
Please don't leave me here, to do it on my own)  
  
First class information  
I'll be your sexual inspiration  
And with some stimulation  
We can do it right  
  
So why waste time  
With the other guys?  
When you can have mine  
I ain't askin' for no sacrifice  
Baby your friends do not need to know!  
I've got a real nice place to go  
  
Listen,  
I don't need you to care  
I don't need you to understand  
All I want is for you to be there  
And when I'm turned on  
If you want me

Do it with me  
  
Now listen  
If you're gonna do it, you know what I say?  
If you're gonna do it don't throw it away  
Don't throw it baby  
Because  
I'll be your boy, I'll be your man  
I'll be the one who understands  
I'll be your first, I'll be your last  
I'll be the only one you ask  
I'll be your friend, I'll be your toy  
I'll be the one who brings you joy  
I'll be your hope, I'll be your pearl  
I'll take you halfway 'round the world!  
I'll make you rich, I'll make you poor  
Just don't use the door  
  
Do it with me

1716,Wham!,Like A Baby,"Foreign skies  
Blinded me to empty charms.  
I crossed the ocean,  
Fell into your arms  
  
So sure, so wrong..  
You sang me a simple tune,  
I took if for a song.  
  
Say goodbye  
Don't tell me why you have to go  
Loving you was as good as gone  
As good as gone.  
  
I'd love to know you  
Really know you  
But you see, there's something you should know,  
I never really thought you'd go  
  
Because today,  
I would have sworn I heard you say  
""I love you""  
""I want you""  
""I need to be with you today""  
I saw something in your face  
  
Stay here beside me,  
I need your love to guide me  
Your love,  
But now it's gone away,  
You left me crying like a baby,  
Like a baby

1717,Wham!,Love Machine,"[Chorus]  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you,  
I'm just a love machine,  
A huggin', kissin' fiend.  
  
I think it's high time you knew,  
Whenever I think of you,  
My mind blows a fuse.  
When I look in you eyes,  
My meter starts to rise, and I become confused.  
My voltage regulator cools,  
When I'm sitting next to you,  
Electricity starts to flow,  
And my indicator starts to glow, wo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wooo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gentle as a lamb,  
I'm not that hard to program,  
There's no way that you can lose,  
My chassis fits like a glove,  
I've got a button for love,  
That you have got-to-use.  
If you look into my file,  
I am sure you can find out how,  
To turn me on just set my dial,  
And let me love you for a little while, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, woo-woo-wo  
Na, na na na na, na na na na, na naaah  
  
I'm just a love machine  
And I won't work for nobody but you.  
I'm just a love machine  
A huggin' kissin' fiend.

1721,Wham!,Where Did Your Heart Go,"I spend my nights down on the wharf  
In unlit alleyways  
By the church downtown  
Where Sally prays  
Come down sometime  
We'll share a rusty can of corn  
And listen to the radio  
I love you, I love you, it says  
  
[Chorus]  
Where did your heart go  
Did you put it on a train  
Did you leave it in the rain  
Or down in Mexico  
  
You cry, but I don't know  
I've heard it all before  
There it goes again, the slamming of the door  
Sometimes the river calls me  
And at night it calls my name  
Says ""put your troubles down beside me""  
Things have always been the same  
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me  
What the river said that night  
I jumped into this beauty  
And drifted out of sight  
  
[Chorus]
