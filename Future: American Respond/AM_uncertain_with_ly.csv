9,"The Royal Guardsmen","Snoopy For President","The time had come to elect a PresidentAnd all the famous candidates thought they were heaven-sentThey screamed and raved and pounded their hands above their heartsBut soon the noble promises were hard to tell apartWaiting at the pumpkin patch, a dog sincere and braveAnd everybody hoped that soon the country he would saveThe pumpkin said ""The day has come for you to take a stand""""For love has left the people across our native land"" 	Some wear the sign of the elephant and some wear the sign of the mule	But we'll hold the sign of the beagle high and love will shine rightthroughAll the politicians, they swore he couldn't winBut Snoopy only shook his head and flashed his famous grinHe jumped into his faithful friend, the Sopwith Camel planeAnd bounced around the countryside from Washington to MaineSome wear the sign of the elephant and some wear the sign of the mule	But we'll hold the sign of the beagle high and love will shine rightthroughNew York State was lookin' bad till Snoopy made a speechSoon Illinois and Tennessee were both within his reachHe won the vote in Oregon but time was growin' thinAnd back at the convention hall, the votes were pourin' inSnoopy smiled his way into the hearts of everyoneBut when the votes were counted up, they found he needed oneThe winning vote for Snoopy came when a stranger raised his handSnoopy turned, the stranger spoke  ""Mein friend, vee meet again!""	Some wear the sign of the elephant and some wear the sign of the mule"
11,"The Royal Guardsmen","The Return Of The Red Baron","You remember that baron flying high in the skyWhen Snoopy shot him down with a gleam in his eyeBut that baron had leaped from his blood-red planeJust before it burst into a ball of flameSnoopy circled back to check his killSaw the bloody red baron standing high on a hillThen he swooped down lowShouted ""Curse you red baron!""The German shook his fist you could hear him swear ""Ach der lieber!""Hey watch out little SnoopyYou're really in a messYou thought you were through with the bloody red baronBut it looks like he's not down yetThen a cry went up all over the landThe bloody red baron would strike againBut brave little Snoopy said ""Never fear""As he headed for his plane all the people cheered (Yeah!)Hey watch out little SnoopyYou're really in a messYou thought you were through with the bloody red baronBut it looks like he's not down yetSnoopy blazed a trail straight across the seaSearching in vain for his enemyThen he found that German trying to fix his planeA-sweatin' and a-cussin' about to go insaneTake itSnoopy landed for a pistol duelThe baron was worriedSnoopy was coolHe fired a shot and missedStarted to runBefore Snoopy had a chance to raise his gunHey watch out red baronSnoopy is on your trailOne of these days he's gonna make you payAnd you'll go straight toWell watch out red baronSnoopy is on your trailOne of these days he's gonna make you payAnd you'll go straight toWell watch out red baron"
15,"The Strangeloves","I Want Candy","I know a girl who's soft and sweetShe's so fine, she can't be beatGot everything that I desireSets the summer sun on fireI want Candy, I want CandyGo to see her with her hair hung downAin't no finer girl in townCandy's just what the doctor orderedShe's so sweet, she makes my mouth waterI want Candy, I want CandyI want Candy, I want CandyI want Candy, I want CandyCandy on the beach, there's nothing betterBut I like Candy when it's wrapped in a sweaterSome day soon I'll make her mineThen I'll have Candy all the timeI want Candy, I want CandyHeyHeyHey"

19,"The Byrds","The Christian Life","My buddies tell me that I should've waited They say I'm missing a whole world of fun But I still love them and I sing with pride I like the Christian life I won't lose a friend by heeding God's callFor what is a friend who'd want you to fall Others find pleasure in things I despise I like the Christian lifeMy buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus They say I'm missing a whole world of fun I live without them and walk in the light I like the Christian life I won't lose a friend by heeding God's callFor what is a friend who'd want you to fall Others find pleasure in things I despise I like the Christian lifeI like the Christian life"
20,"The Byrds","My Back Pages","Crimson flames tied through my yearsRollin' high and mighty trapsCountless fire on flaming roadsUsing ideas as my maps""We'll meet our legends, soon,"" said IProud 'neath heated brow.Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth""Rip down all hate,"" I screamedLies that life is black and whiteSpoke from my skull. I dreamedRomantic facts of musketeersFoundations deep, somehow.Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.In a soldier's stance, I aimed my handAt the mongrel dogs who teachFearing not that I'd become my enemyIn the instant that I preachMy pathway led by confusion boatsMutiny from stern to bow.Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threatsToo noble to neglectDeceived me into thinkingI had something to protectGood and bad, I define these termsQuite clear, no doubt, somehow.Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now."
21,"The Byrds","I Knew I'd Want You","I'd like to love you , with all of my heartYou've had me on your trip, right from the startAnd when you looked at me, with love in your eyesI knew I'd want you, oh yeahI'd like to hold you, if you want me toI've found something new girl, just by looking at youAnd it's in your smile, and it's in the wayI knew I'd want you, oh yeahI meet so many people, I feel I don't knowBut I felt so close to you, when you said helloI'd like to love you, and together we'd findThe place we've been looking for, we'll have peace of mindThere we'll be happy, and there I'll know whyI knew I'd want you, oh yeah"
22,"The Byrds","Bad Night At The Whiskey","Pushed me off the street todayThe light in my eyes gets in the wayOf the darkness you pushed me inYou say that it's a sin we're hanging aroundYou told me not to sing todayYou say my music gets in the wayCause it walks on in just as you beginBinging my soul brothers downAnd although you're smilingYour hate will not ceaseSo just face yourself babeAnd leave me in peaceWell I'll stay out of your wayIf you stay out of mineIf I could let the evil goOh, you know we'll both go down in fire"
23,"The Byrds","So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star","So you want to be a rock and roll star?Then listen now to what I say.Just get an electric guitarThen take some timeAnd learn how to play.And with your hair swung right,And your pants too tightIt's gonna be all right.Then it's time to go downtownWhere the agent man won't let you down.Sell your soul to the companyWho are waiting there to sell plastic ware.And in a week or twoIf you make the chartsThe girls'll tear you apart.The price you paid for your riches and fame,Was it all a strange game?You're a little insane.The money, the fame, and the public acclaim,Don't forget who you are,You're a rock and roll star.Your request matches 1 albums and 4 songs."
24,"The Byrds","Turn! Turn! Turn!","To everything, turn, turn, turn.There is a season, turn, turn, turn.And a time to every purpose under heaven.A time to be born, a time to die.A time to plant, a time to reap.A time to kill, a time to heal.A time to laugh, a time to weep.To everything, turn, turn, turn.There is a season, turn, turn, turn.And a time to every purpose under heaven.A time to build up, a time to break down.A time to dance, a time to mourn.A time to cast away stones.A time to gather stones together.To everything, turn, turn, turn.There is a season, turn, turn, turn.And a time to every purpose under heaven.A time of love, a time of hate.A time of war, a time of peace.A time you may embrace.A time to refrain from embracing.To everything, turn, turn, turn.There is a season, turn, turn, turn.And a time to every purpose under heaven.A time to gain, a time to lose.A time to rend, a time to sew.A time for love, a time for hate.A time for peace, I swear it's not too late."
25,"The Byrds","Citizen Kane","Fat ugly fat man swamIn a red tire made of stoneA painted lady paddled next to himWith two poodles on her lapGarbo quietly picked a flowerWhile the chauffeur won his check againAnd barrymore took a noon day nap? ? ?And diamond fell like rainCisco kid and a bald headed waitressTrapped 'neath a bed of brassThe french cook served them chocolatesAnd some cold cuts on the grassLouilla ripped her zebra pantsIn the polo loungeAnd errol flynn was not let inCause he was coming downUp in zanadu diamonds fell like rainCitizen kane was king poor citizen kaneValentino suddenly appearedIn his midnight blue tuxedoHad a falcon on his shoulderEating chicken from his handsAnd fatty arbuckle waddled byOn way to the bath house greenFrankenstein ate the leading ladyAnd licked the carcass cleanUp in zanadu diamonds fell like rainCitizen kane was king poor citizen kane"
26,"The Byrds","Everybody's Been Burned","Everybody's been burned beforeEverybody knows the painAnyone in this placeCan tell you to your faceWhy you shouldn't try to love someone Everybody knows it never worksEverybody knows, and me I know that doorThat shuts just beforeYou get to the dream you seeI know all too wellHow to turn, how to run how to hideBehind a bitter wall of blueBut you die inside if you choose to hideSo I guess I'll love you"
27,"The Byrds","You Won't Have To Cry","Oh you know it makes me sad to see you feel so bad But it's happened to you many times before But if you will come with me, then girl you will see That you won't have to cry anymore There's no reason to feel blue because of what he says to you And I wouldn't want to see you hurt no more I could never do you wrong 'cause my love for you is too strong And you won't have to cry anymore Oh I saw you there with tears in your eyes Because he told you so many lies Of you know it isn't right to put yourself uptight By thinking about the things he's done before Just trust your love in me and girl you will see that You won't have to cry No, you won't have to cry No, you won't have to cry anymore"
28,"The Byrds","Lay Down Your Weary Tune","Lay down your weary tune, lay downLay down the song you strumAnd rest yourself beneath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to humStruck by the sounds before the sunI knew the night had goneThe morning breeze like a bugle blewAgainst the drums of dawnLay down your weary tune, lay downLay down the song you strumAnd rest yourself beneath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to humThe ocean wild like an organ playedThe seaweed wove and strandsThe crashin' waves like cymbals clashedAgainst the rocks and sandsLay down your weary tune, lay downLay down the song you strumAnd rest yourself beneath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to humThe last of leaves fell from the treesAnd clung to a new love's breastThe branches bare like a banjo monkTo the winds that listened the bestLay down your weary tune, lay downLay down the song you strumAnd rest yourself beneath the strength of stringsNo voice can hope to hum"
29,"The Byrds","Goin' Back","I think I'm goin' backTo the things I learned so well in my youthI think I'm returning toThose days when I was young enough to know the truthNow there are no games to only pass the timeNo more electric trains, no more trees to climbBut thinking young and growing older is no sinAnd I can play the game of life to winI can recall a timeWhen I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friendNow, I think I've gotA lot more than just my toys to lendNow there's more to do than watch my sailboat glideBut every day can be a magic carpet rideA little bit of courage is all we lackSo catch me if you can, I'm goin' backNow there's more to do than watch my sailboat glideBut every day can be a magic carpet rideA little bit of courage is all we lackSo catch me if you can, I'm goin' back"
30,"The Byrds","Chimes Of Freedom","Far between sundown's finish an' midnights broken tollWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashingAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the soundSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashingFlashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fightFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flightAn' for each an' every underdog soldier in the nightAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashedAn' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly liftingElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the onesCondemned to drift or else be kept from driftingTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trailFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a taleAn' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jailAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caughtTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspendedAs we listened one last time an' we watched with one last lookSpellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling endedTolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursedFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worseAn' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universeAn' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing."
31,"The Byrds","It's No Use","It's no use sayin' you're gonna stay if you don't want to be all mineI haven't got room for somebody who's gonna hurt me all the timeSomebody who couldn't see all the love I was tryin' to giveIt's no use sayin' you're gonna stay if you don't want our love to liveIt's no uese keepin' you around if you don't want me all the wayThere's somebody new who can be found and I'll find her somedayAnd she will be everything, all the love she has she'll want to giveIt's no use sayin' you're gonna stay if you don't want our love to liveOh I should be good to you but I can't 'cause beforeI was really true to you but you only hurt me moreIt's no use sayin' you're gonna stay if you don't want to be all mineI haven't got room for somebody who's gonna hurt me all the timeSomebody who couldn't see all the love I was tryin' to giveIt's no use sayin' you're gonna stay if you don't want our love to live"
32,"The Byrds","Jesus Is Just Alright","Jesus is just all right with meJesus is just all right, oh yeahJesus is just all right with meJesus is just all rightI don't care what they may knowI don't care where they may goI don't care what they may knowJesus is just all right, oh yeahJesus is just all rightI don't care what they may sayI don't care what they may doI don't care what they may sayJesus is just all right, oh yeahJesus is just all rightDo, do, do, etc.Jesus is just all right with meJesus is just all right, oh yeahJesus is just all right with meJesus is just all rightJesus is just all right with meJesus is just all right, oh yeahJesus is just all right with meJesus is just all right"
33,"The Byrds","Candy","Drifted in school, Daddy's a foolWe know someone's on your mindWomen whose face, velvet and laceCurling couplets into time and spaceMeet the man who needs you nowCan you give your love away like Candy?Down on your knees, trimming the treesCan you imagine what it's likeLovers lament, general dissentDoctor's orders are unkind, and bentMeet the man who needs you nowCan you give your love away like Candy?Very profound, merry-go-roundSpinning innocence and dreamsCan you believe, all you perceiveLove is never what it seemed to beMeet the man who needs you nowCan you give your love away like Candy?"
35,"The Byrds","The World Turns All Around Her","Well if you think she's everything you could wantAnd if you think she's everything that could beWell I still think the world turns all around herAnd I still wish that she belonged to meI don't know how I ever could thought thatI'd let her go and still be just the sameWell I found out my world turned all around herAnd every where I go I hear her nameSomewhere along the way I don't know whyI thought that I would want to let her goBut now whenever I see her with you IRealize how much I didn't knowSo if you tell her everyday you love herAnd if you tell her everything she could beYou'll find out that your world will turn around herYou'll feel the same if you should set her free"
36,"The Byrds","Satisfied Mind","How many times have you heard someone say""If I had his money, I could do things my way?""Little they know that it's so hard to findOne rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.Once I was waitin' for fortune and fameEverything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's gameSuddenly it happened, I lost every dimeBut I'm richer by far with a satisfied mindMoney can't buy back your youth when you're oldOr a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown coldThe wealthiest person is a pauper at timesCompared to the man with a satisfied mindWhen my life is ended, my time has run outMy trials and my loved ones, I'll leave them no doubtBut one thing's for certain, when it comes my timeI'll leave this old world with a satisfied mindI'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind"
37,"The Byrds","I See You","I see youUnder there behind your hairEverywhere, I see youI see youTurned on eyes can't tell liesEmpathize, I see youWarm sliding sun through the cave of you hairWind washing fields kind of space living thereI see youWho lives there?Tell old fair I'm awareThat she cares, who lives there?We thought howFor a while they just smileJust a silent thoughtI see youSun is there behind your hairEverywhere, I see youI see you"
38,"The Byrds","Hickory Wind","In South Carolina there are many tall pinesI remember the oak tree that we used to climbBut now when I'm lonesome, I always pretendThat I'm getting the feel of hickory windI started out younger at most everythingAll the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring?But it makes me feel better each time it beginsCallin' me home, hickory windIt's hard way to find out that trouble is realIn a far away city, with a far away feelBut it makes me feel better each time it beginsCallin' me home, hickory windKeeps callin' me home, hickory wind"
39,"The Byrds","Mind Gardens","Once upon a time, there was a garden on a high hillStandin' green and [Incomprehensible] against the seaAnd there the sun came and the rain pourin' downThe garden grew and splattered bits of color on the groundAnd took shape and symmetry all aroundThere came winds, driven and howlin'There came snow and I feared for the gardenSo I built a wall and another, roofed it over, thick and strongI kept it from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortuneBut when the sun came and the gentle rain of springThey could not find the garden behind those wallsIt would have died, safely, securely, diedBut as I watched and as I learnedI tore the walls all down, the garden still lives"
40,"The Byrds","Artificial Energy","Sitting all alone nowI took my ticket to rideJust a matter of time nowTil I'll be up in the sky.Coming up on me now,I'm king for a nightWhat's it gonna be now?How willful things are building insightDo you think it's really the trip that you seek?I've got my doubts it's happened to me.Artificial energyI've got a strange feelingI'm going to die before my time'Cause I'm coming down off amphetaminesAnd I'm in jail 'cause I killed the queen."

42,"The Byrds","Pretty Boy Floyd","Well gather round children, a story I will tellAbout Pretty Boy Floyd the outlaw, Oklahoma knew him wellWas in the town of Shawnee on a Saturday afternoonHis wife beside him in a wagon as into town they rodeAnd along come a deputy sheriff in a manner rather rudeUsing vulgar words of language and his wife she overheardAnd Pretty Boy Floyd grabbed a long chain, and the deputy grabbed a gunAnd in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy downThen he ran through the trees and bushes and lived a life of shameEvery crime in Oklahoma was added to his nameHe ran through trees and bushes on the Canadian River shoreAnd many a starving farmer opened up his doorIt was in Oklahoma City, It was on a Christmas DayA whole carload of groceries and a letter that did sayWell you say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thiefWell, here's a Christmas dinner for the families on reliefAs through this life you travel, you meet some funny menSome rob you with a six-gun, some with a fountain penAs through this life you ramble, as through this life you roamYou'll never see an outlaw take a family from their home"
43,"The Byrds","I Trust","In times of despair I think about the good things you've doneAnd though you're not there I sometimes ask myself is anyone?It's hard being human when the whole world's uptightBut somehow I know that everything's gonna work out alrightI might lose my patience but won't you please try to understandI've got obligations and I intend to face them and take my standOh, it's so hard being human with only troubles in sightBut somehow I know that everything's gonna work out alright Yes I do, yeah!Stick by me baby in spite of my faultsThat's all I want you to do and try to help me (Help me) When I'm down (Help me) and I'll take good care of youI want to thank you for all the tender loving that you giveIt brightens my feelings and gives me strength and need to liveOh, it's so hard being human with only troubles in sightBut somehow I know that everything's gonna work out alrightSomehow I know that everything's gonna work out alright"
