The lights close their tired eyes.  
I'll soon be with you, my love,  
To give you my dawn surprise.  
I'll be with you, darling, soon,  
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.  
  
I'm with you, my love.  
The light shining through on you.  
Yes, I'm with you, my love,  
It's the morning and just we two.  
I'll stay with you, darling, now,  
I'll stay with you till my seeds are dried up.  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love.

1,"Dusty Springfield","Stay Awhile","I'm touching your face and I  
Can't get very far  
You travel a million miles  
Always in the stars  
And crossing the clouds  
A fading moon  
Whispered ""It's goodbye""  
But as it starts to die  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Tell me who you are  
  
I've never believed in much  
What can I be worth ?  
I'm always a shooting star  
Falling down to earth  
I prayed in my heart  
You'd never know  
Feelings wouldn't show  
But now before you go  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Tell me who you are  
  
And crossing the clouds  
A fading moon  
Whispers ""It's goodbye""  
But as it starts to die  
  
Stay awhile  
Show your love  
Child among the stars  
Just stay awhile  
Lay with me  
Show me who you are  
  
Just stay awhile

You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now  
Oh yeah, you really got me now  
You got me so I can't sleep at night  
  
You really got me  
You really got me  
You really got me

'Cause summers here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy  
Tell me what can a poor boy do

24,"The Rolling Stones","Time Is On My Side","You are the sunshine baby of my life  
Oh baby you are just the one  
Without you oh I can't go on  
You are the one, only the strong survive  
Oh Baby I can't let you go  
I promised you, my love will show  
  
Time is on my side  
Tonight it's our night  
Time is on my side  
Love we cannot hide  
  
You are the nearest thing to heaven girl  
Oh baby you are just the one  
Without you oh I can't be strong  
You are the only star in my new world  
Oh baby I can't let you go  
I promised you, my love will grow

25,"The Rolling Stones","We Love You","We've got to get a message to the stars above  
Like radios in heaven hearing just enough  
And every single tear drop along the way  
We put them in our pockets for a rainy day  
  
But here we are in truoble  
Like we always are  
Just praying for a mriacle  
And reaching for stars  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
We got to get a message to the promised land  
Like semaphores in motion so they'll understand  
But every single vision that we saw today  
We didn't quite believe it in the usual way  
Yet here we are in heaven  
Who could wnat for more  
We always end up getting what we're asking for  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
It's just another promise like we've heard before  
We're never really knowing what we're fighting for  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
We love you  
Wouldn't leave you  
We miss you  
Far away  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day  
  
We miss you  
Far away  
  
We love you  
Would die for you  
We need you  
Every day

26,"Tom Jones","Green, Green Grass Of Home","The old hometown looks the same  
As I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and papa  
And down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms a-reaching, smiling sweetly  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
The old house is still standing  
Though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
And then suddenly I awake and look around me  
At these cold grey walls that surround me  
And it's then that I realize that I was only dreaming  
For there stands a guard and there's the sad old padre  
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak  
And once again I'll touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home...
