"776","Roger Miller","Vance","He was born one mornin' It was cold and it was snowin' And from the start he never had a chance And though the doctors said he couldn't live His mama had some faith to give And they brought him to her and his mama named him Vance  He was sick a long time then I used to sit by him I'd rub his head and he would squeeze my hand But he never cried, he'd grit his teeth and smile at me 'Cause he couldn't speak And that's when I began to respect the little man And I think Vance was three right about then  He started school and one day He came home and at the doorway I could tell The little man didn't want to come inside He had met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty Had caught him walkin' home with her And nearly killed Vance But then Vance never cried And the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride  And he said  ""Papa do you become a man when you're twenty-one?"" And I said ""Age doesn't make a man a man, my son""  He looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind 'n' I think Vance was seven about that time  I guess they say that first love is the very best At least it was with Vance 'Cause he'd scratched ""Becky"" on his desk But Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small And he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall And then a few years later Vance came in one day And told me and his mama that he had to go away To be fitted for a uniform And though his mama shed a tear He kissed her and said he'd see us in two years And he looked at me and said ""Papa, I'm gonna be a man""  Well, two years to the day Vance came walkin' in the driveway and I didn't recognize him from his size till he got near He came in and he hugged his mama And said ""Hey, Papa, little man, want to go with me somewhere 'n' grab a beer?"" So we're sittin' at this table when This fella at the bar started buggin' Vance Callin' him ""Soldier"" But Vance kept his cool And he said ""Papa, that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now 'Cause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school.""  Then Smitty said the wrong thing When he brought up Becky's name 'n' Vance finally stood and said ""Boy, what did you say?"" And it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty And it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away  Well, Vance left the very next mornin' 'n' It was cold and it was snowin' And from the first, life hadn't been much fun But he had finally made a stand 'n' He'd become a self-made man and Incidentally, he had just turned twenty-one",3,9

Thank you Carl  Well,my daddy left home when I was three And he didn't leave much to ma and me Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid But the meanest thing that he ever did Was before he left, he went and named me Sue  Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk It seems I had to fight my whole life through Some gal would giggle and I'd get red And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head, I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue  Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean My fist got hard and my wits got keen I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame But I made a vow to the moon and stars That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars And kill that man who gave me that awful name  Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July And I just hit town and my throat was dry I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew At an old saloon on a street of mud There at a table, dealing stud Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue  Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye He was big and bent and gray and old And I looked at him and my blood ran cold And I said, ""My name is Sue, how do you do Now you're gonna die""  (yeah, that's what I told him)  Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes And he went down, but to my surprise He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear But I busted a chair right across his teeth And we crashed through the wall and into the street Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer  I tell ya, I've fought tougher men But I really can't remember when He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss He went for his gun and I pulled mine first He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile  And he said, ""Son, this world is rough And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along So I give ya that name and I said goodbye I knew you'd have to get tough or die And it's the name that helped to make you strong""  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight And I know you hate me, and you got the right To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do But ya ought to thank me, before I die For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye 'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""  Well what could I do? What could I do? I got all choked up and I threw down my gun And I called him my paw, and he called me his son And I came away with a different point of view And I think about him, now and then Every time I try and every time I win And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him..

"203","Bob Dylan","I Want You","The guilty undertaker sighs, The lonely organ grinder cries, The silver saxophones say I should refuse you. The cracked bells and washed-out horns Blow into my face with scorn, But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you. I want you, I want you, I want you so bad, Honey, I want you.  The drunken politician leaps Upon the street where mothers weep And the saviors who are fast asleep, They wait for you. And I wait for them to interrupt Me drinkin' from my broken cup And ask me to Open up the gate for you. I want you, I want you, I want you so bad, Honey, I want you.  Now all my fathers, they've gone down, True love they've been without it. But all their daughters put me down Cause I don't think about it.  Well, I return to the Queen of Spades And talk with my chambermaid. She knows that I'm not afraid To look at her. She is good to me And there's nothing she doesn't see. She knows where I'd like to be But it doesn't matter. I want you, I want you, I want you so bad, Honey, I want you.  Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit, He spoke to me, I took his flute. No, I wasn't very cute to him, Was I? But I did it, though, because he lied Because he took you for a ride And because time was on his side And because I  I want you, I want you, I want you so bad, Honey, I want you.",3,1
